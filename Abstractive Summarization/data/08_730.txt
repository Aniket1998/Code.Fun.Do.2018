 INTRODUCTION  Nature of the proceedings  1 These two proceedings are two of nine related class actions or representative proceedings under Pt IVA of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (FCA Act) against the same respondent (Veda).Veda was once called "Baycorp Advantage Business Information Services Limited".2 The nine proceedings and the applicants in them respectively are as follows: NSD 368 of 2007 Melissa Marie Szyczew NSD 369 of 2007 Catherine Leanne Lyons NSD 370 of 2007 Cheryl A Matthews NSD 371 of 2007 Andrew Bailey  (the Bailey proceeding) NSD 372 of 2007 David William Hines NSD 373 of 2007 Matthew Zion Rose NSD 377 of 2007 Albert William Kapua NSD 378 of 2007 Stephen John Gregory NSD 393 of 2007 Zashca Knochell (the Knochell proceeding)  I will often refer to "the applicants" in the plural, even though the two notices of motion with which these reasons are concerned were each filed in only one of the proceedings (being the Bailey proceeding or the Knochell proceeding) as outlined below.It is common ground that the two motions have application to all nine proceedings.3 The Bailey proceeding is the lead proceeding.Down to the present time all interlocutory steps have been taken in the Bailey proceeding on the basis that they would also have application to the other eight proceedings.Unfortunately, the solicitors representing the applicants discovered that they had misspelt Ms Knochell's first name as "Zashca".They filed the notice of motion to which I refer below in the Knochell proceeding rather than in the Bailey proceeding, apparently in order to seek an order that Ms Knochell's name as it appears in the title of the Knochell proceeding be corrected (I note, in passing, that they also wrongly stated Veda's name as "Veda Advantage Information Service and Solutions Limited" rather than "Veda Advantage Information Services and Solutions Limited" on the notice of motion and supporting affidavit).This has led to the anomaly that whereas until the present time all interlocutory steps have been taken in the Bailey proceeding, of the two motions to which the present reasons relate, one is brought by Ms Knochell in the Knochell proceeding, while the other is brought by Veda in the Bailey proceeding.4 Of the nine class actions, three relate to events in New South Wales, three to events in Victoria, and the remaining three to events in Queensland.5 In Bailey v Veda Advantage Information Services and Solutions Limited [2007] FCA 1664 (the Earlier Reasons), I described the general nature of the nine proceedings as follows (at [3]-[6]): 3 All nine are brought by individuals on behalf of themselves and others whose complaints concern information provided by Veda to credit providers relating to the creditworthiness of the applicants and of the group members they respectively represent.Veda is a credit reporting agency, that is to say, it is a corporation that carries on a credit reporting business (I am using expressions taken from the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), ss 6 and 11A ).4 Credit providers subscribe to Veda in order to have the benefit of information related to the creditworthiness of individuals who apply to them for credit.Veda maintains credit information files on a computer database in relation to individuals.The credit providers who subscribe are able to access, by computer, the credit information files that are part of the system set up by Veda.In addition, the subscribers themselves may update the information on those files by providing information known to them concerning individuals.5 Accordingly, Veda's subscribers are both the suppliers of information to the credit information files and the recipients of information from those files.I was told that on the final hearing there will be considerable evidence concerning the way in which the system just outlined operates.6 In the way in which the proceedings have been cast, each of the three relates to the reporting of a particular kind of problem associated with a person's creditworthiness.In the case of proceeding NSD 368/2007 in which Ms Szyczew is the applicant, the complaint is that the word "Bankrupts" was recorded and conveyed to subscribers in respect of Ms Szyczew and the members of the group on whose behalf she sues.In the case of proceeding NSD 371/2007 in which Mr Bailey is the applicant, the complaint is that the expression "Clearouts" or "Clearouts (watched)" was recorded and conveyed to subscribers in respect of Mr Bailey and the members of the group on whose behalf he sues.I infer that what is meant by those expressions is that the person, owing money, has ceased to be contactable.In proceeding NSD 393/2007 in which Mr Knochell is the applicant, the complaint is that the expression "Payment Default" was recorded and conveyed to subscribers in respect of Mr Knochell and the members of the group on whose behalf he sues.I note that the subscribers are also referred to as "members".6 In each proceeding, claims were made of contravention by Veda of ss 52 and 53 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the TP Act), defamation and negligence.The claims of contravention of s 53 of the TP Act and of defamation have now been abandoned.Circumstances leading to the filing of the present motions  7 On 20 February 2008, I made the following orders in each of the nine proceedings:   1.The proceeding be dismissed.2.The applicant pay the respondent's costs of the proceeding.3.Orders 1 and 2 not be entered without the leave of the Court.4.The respondent have leave to apply by motion on notice for leave to enter orders 1 and 2.5.The applicant have leave to apply by motion on notice for an order setting aside orders 1 and 2.6.The motion referred to in order 5 above be supported by affidavit attaching a copy of any proposed further amended application and proposed further amended statement of claim. 8 The making of the orders on 20 February 2008 was the culmination of: 2#8226; Orders of 7 November 2007 striking out the applicants' amended application and amended statement of claim; 2#8226; A case management conference held on 18 December 2007 and the making of an order on that day that the applicants file any further amended application and any further amended statement of claim by 15 February 2008; 2#8226; A directions hearing on 20 February 2008 at which the applicants sought an extension of time in which to file any further amended application and any further amended statement of claim.9 Pursuant to order 4 of 20 February 2008, on 25 February 2008, Veda filed a notice of motion in the Bailey proceeding seeking leave to enter orders 1 and 2 of 20 February 2008.The supporting affidavit showed that the nine proceedings have been listed in the Court on 13 separate occasions since they were commenced on 12 March 2007.10 Shortly afterwards, on 5 March 2008, Ms Knochell filed a notice of motion pursuant to order 5 of 20 February 2008 seeking an order setting aside orders 1 and 2 of that date.The supporting affidavit annexes a proposed further amended application (as at 4 March 2008) (PFAA) and a proposed further amended statement of claim (also as at 4 March 2008) (PFASOC).I have annexed to these reasons a copy of the PFASOC (omitting tracking).Veda indicated that it was content to have the motions determined on the basis of the PFAA and the PFASOC.11 The supporting affidavit in Ms Knochell's proceeding explains the delay in the filing of her notice of motion.As it transpires, I have not needed to concern myself with the question of any delay.APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES  12 There was debate before me as to the appropriate principles to apply in determination of the motions, having regard to the fact that an order of dismissal was made on 20 February 2008.The applicants contend that their application to set aside the orders of dismissal should be treated as any application for leave to file an amended pleading is treated.They submit that if they have an arguable case, they should not be shut out by a pleading deficiency, and should, if necessary, have a further opportunity to rectify the position.13 Veda, on the other hand, contends that the applicants are entitled to little indulgence in view of the order of dismissal and of the history of the proceedings.Veda points out that the PFAA and the PFASOC are the ninth versions put forward by the applicants.The applicants do not dispute this, although they correctly point out that far fewer than nine versions have been actually filed.The reason, however, is that in order to avoid the filing of various versions of the application and statement of claim by the applicants, followed by the filing of notices of motion by Veda seeking orders for summary dismissal or striking out, I sometimes directed the applicants to provide drafts to Veda's solicitors and those solicitors to respond by indicating any objections they had to the drafts.Veda therefore correctly observes that although there are far fewer than nine versions to be found on the Court file, Veda has been put to the expense, either upon formal motion or pursuant to Court direction, of responding to nine.14 On the present motions, the applicants have indicated that they would wish, or are willing, to amend the PFAA and PFASOC further.For example, they wish to add a further common question of fact to the PFAA.Moreover, in response to Veda's objection to the difficulty of dealing with lengthy, discursive and "rolled up" allegations in the PFASOC, the applicants reply that they are willing to divide the text up into numbered paragraphs.It is unsatisfactory for the applicants to make this offer in the course of a hearing related to the ninth version of their pleading.15 In the Earlier Reasons, I referred (at [13]) to the burden that was imposed on the Court (as well as on Veda) by reason of the applicants repeatedly indicating an intention or willingness to amend in the course of the hearing.Indeed, I made it a condition of any exercise of leave to amend further that the solicitors and counsel for the applicants certify that any further amended documents to be filed had been carefully checked and found to be correct so far as form is concerned.The PFASOC bears a statement to this effect (though, as Veda points out, it has not been "certified" in the sense that it has not been signed).Yet the PFASOC does not comply with O 11 r 1 of the Federal Court Rules (Cth) (FC Rules) which provides: Where a pleading alleges or otherwise deals with several matters ---   (a) the pleading shall be divided into paragraphs;      (b) each matter shall, so far as convenient, be put in a separate paragraph; and      (c) the paragraphs shall be numbered consecutively.  This rule serves an important purpose, namely, that of facilitating discourse in relation to the applicants' allegations, and, in particular, of facilitating the making of responses to them.I agree with Veda's criticism of the pleading.16 In essence, Veda submits that "enough is enough" and that any deficiencies remaining in this, the ninth attempt to formulate a satisfactory form of application and pleading, should be viewed strictly.17 In my view, it was implicit in the orders I made on 20 February 2008 that the applicants would have to show cause why Veda should not be entitled to enter the order of dismissal.I need deal only with the claims as they stand in the PFAA and PFASOC.18 The powers of the Court relevant to the making of the orders of 7 November 2007 and 20 February 2008 (referred to at [7]-[8] above), and also relevant to the present motions, are:  FCA Act  Section 31A:   (2) The Court may give judgment for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of a proceeding if:      (a) the first party is defending the proceeding or that part of the proceeding; and (b) the Court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the proceeding.     (3) For the purposes of this section, a defence or a proceeding or part of a proceeding need not be: (a) hopeless; or (b) bound to fail; for it to have no reasonable prospect of success. Section 33ZF(1):   (1) In any proceeding (including an appeal) conducted under this Part, the Court may, of its own motion or on application by a party or a group member, make any order the Court thinks appropriate or necessary to ensure that justice is done in the proceeding.  FC Rules    Order 11 rule 16: Where a pleading: (a) discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence or other case appropriate to the nature of the pleading; (b) has a tendency to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay in the proceeding; or (c) is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court;  the Court may at any stage of the proceeding order that the whole or any part of the pleading be struck out.THE FIRST REMAINING CLAIM --- THE CLAIM UNDER S 52 OF THE TP ACT  19 Veda submits that s 65A of the TP Act supplies a complete answer to the applicants' claim based on the alleged contravention of s 52 of that Act, so that that claim has no reasonable prospect of success.So far as relevant, s 65A provides:   (1) Nothing in section 52 ... applies to a prescribed publication of matter by a prescribed information provider, other than:  (a) a publication of matter in connection with:    (i) the supply or possible supply of goods or services;   (ii) ... (iii) the promotion by any means of the supply or use of goods and services; or (iv) ... where: (v) the goods or services were relevant goods or services ...    (vi) ...  (b) ...      (2) For the purposes of this section, a publication by a prescribed information provider is a prescribed publication if:      (a) ... the publication was made by the prescribed information provider in the course of carrying on a business of providing information; or (b) ...      (3) In this section:     prescribed information provider means a person who carries on a business of providing information ...     relevant goods or services in relation to a prescribed information provider, means goods or services of a kind supplied by the prescribed information provider ...   20 According to paras 14 and 15 of the PFASOC, Veda supplied to its members credit reports that contained representations.The issuing of the credit reports is the conduct by Veda that is said to have contravened s 52 of the TP Act.21 It is not disputed that Veda carries on a business of providing information and is therefore a "prescribed information provider".Nor is it in dispute that Veda issued the credit reports in the course of carrying on that business, with the result that the issuing of each of them was a "prescribed publication" within the definition in s 65A(2).It follows that the issuing of each credit report was a prescribed publication of a matter to which, by reason of s 65A(1), s 52 of the TP Act does not apply, unless the issuing of the credit report falls within the s 65A(1)(a) exception.22 For that exception to apply, the publication of the credit reports must be in connection with the supply, possible supply or promotion by any means of the supply or use, of goods and services.The applicants have referred to Veda as having supplied both goods and services.I need not decide whether this analysis is correct and will proceed on the assumption that it is.On this basis, apparently the credit reports are the relevant goods, and the conveying of the information contained in them is the relevant service.The applicants also plead (in para 10(d) of the PFASOC) that the "Internet Service Guide" (also known as the "User Guide") was one of the Veda's goods or services.For present purposes, I accept that it and the information contained in it are also within the expression "goods or services of a kind supplied by the prescribed information provider" within the definition of "relevant goods or services" in s 65A(3).It is therefore the credit reports and the User Guide, and the supplying of the information conveyed by them that are the "goods or services" referred to in paras (i) and (v) of s 65A(1)(a).(Henceforward, for convenience, I will refer simply to the credit reports and sometimes to the User Guide, in each case as including the conveyance of the information contained in them.)  23 For the applicants' argument to succeed, the publication of the credit reports must be in connection with the supply, possible supply or promotion by any means of the supply or use, of credit reports or the User Guide.The applicants raise no complaint of a publication of misleading matter in the User Guide.They plead only that the credit reports themselves have contravened s 52.24 The applicants submit that there was a cross promotion of "enhanced reports".I infer that this expression refers to the instances of credit reports pleaded in paras 10(h)(ii) and 10(h)(iii) of the PFASOC.The enhanced reports are therefore themselves credit reports.At the hearing, counsel for the applicants attempted to explain how this promotion occurred.He seemed to suggest that the supply of the credit reports themselves was in connection with the supply, possible supply, or promotion of the supply or use, of the credit reports or "enhanced reports".The authorities stand against that analysis: Horwitz Grahame Books Pty Ltd v Performance Publications Pty Ltd (1987) 8 IPR 25 at 29; Advanced Hair Studios Pty Ltd v TVW Enterprises Ltd (1987) 18 FCR 1 at 10-11; Lovatt v Consolidated Magazines Pty Ltd (1988) 12 IPR 261 at 273; Bond v Barry [2007] FCA 1484 at [42] .25 The kind of situation that would be within the exception would be, by way of hypothetical example, a promotion by Veda that if a subscriber used (and therefore paid for) the reporting services supplied by Veda above a certain number of times over a certain period, a reduced charge would apply.If, in such a case there was in fact no applicable reduced charge, s 65A would not render s 52 inapplicable to Veda's promotional misstatement, because the making of the statement would have been a publication of matter in connection with the supply or possible supply of the credit reports.26 Counsel for the applicants also suggested that the User Guide promoted the supply or use of the credit reports.He stated that the User Guide "explain[s] how in order to get a better value for [a] credit report...you should also order the enhanced report...".The PFASOC nowhere alleges that the User Guide contains such a statement.In any event, I am not persuaded that by reason of this promotion within the User Guide, the credit reports are published in connection with the promotion of the supply or use of the Veda's goods and services so as to enliven s 65A(1)(a) in relation to the credit reports.It may be that the publication of the User Guide, if it contains the statements alleged, is in connection with the promotion of the supply or use of Veda's credit reports.But the PFASOC does not complain that the User Guide contravened s 52 of the TP Act.27 The applicants' and represented claimants' cases are quite straightforward.The only representations of which complaint is made are those contained in the credit reports.They fall squarely within s 65A(1) and therefore nothing in s 52 applies to them.28 The nine proceedings, in so far as they are founded on an alleged contravention of s 52 of the TP Act, cannot succeed.THE SECOND REMAINING CLAIM --- THE CLAIM OF NEGLIGENCE  29 The applicants rely on a common law claim of negligence, and state in their submissions that they "press the causes of action for negligence under the common law at pars [23-27]".No mention is made of a claim of breach of a statutory duty in those submissions.In their supplementary submissions, however, the applicants state that they plead at para [23] of the PFASOC that Veda owed them a statutory duty.That statutory duty is articulated in the PFASOC only by the listing of various provisions of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Privacy Act) in the particulars to para 23 (and also in the particulars to para 12) of the PFASOC.The relevance of those provisions of the Privacy Act is not elaborated upon elsewhere in the PFASOC.The expression "common law principles" is also listed within the particulars to para 23.I accept Veda's submission that if a statutory duty of care is relied upon, as the applicants' supplementary submissions suggest, the fact is that it has not been pleaded.30 A common law duty of care and a statutory duty of care are two distinct species of duty: see Glass HH, McHugh MH and Douglas FM, The Liability of Employers in Damages for Personal Injury (2 nd Ed, Law Book Co, 1979) at 115.However, the statutory context may be relevant to the existence of a duty of care in accordance with common law principles.McDougall J stated in Ingot Capital Investments v Macquarie Equity Capital Markets (No 6) (2007) 63 ACSR 1 at [540]: Recent decisions of the High Court make it plain, in the context of a claim for pure economic loss, that: (1)... .... (7) The relevant statutory and common law context, including the allocation of responsibilities and the provision of remedies, is relevant to the determination, whether a duty of care should be imposed in a particular case...In support, his Honour cited Esanda Finance Corporation Limited v Peat Marwick Hungerfords [1997] HCA 8 ; (1997) 188 CLR 241 , 282, 286 per McHugh J; Perre v Apand Pty Limited [1999] HCA 36 ; (1999) 198 CLR 180 at [5] per Gleeson CJ; Tame at [6], [120] per McHugh J.31 Having regard to these authorities, I do not think that the provisions of the Privacy Act referred to in the particulars either give rise to an actionable statutory duty, or disturb the course of reasoning set out below in relation to the existence and pleading of a common law duty of care.The Privacy Act establishes its own regime for dealing with failures by a credit reporting agency to comply with that Act's requirements.32 The applicants put at the forefront of their case on negligence the proposition that their case is a "system case".They claim that by establishing its system and not taking any, or any adequate, steps to ensure that only correct data were entered, Veda was in breach of a duty of care it owed to potential seekers of credit.They deprecated Veda's business system as an "honour system", that is to say, as a system that depended for its correctness merely on the honour of subscribers.33 In focussing on Veda's system, the applicants distinguish systemic negligence from casual negligence.They submit that while they could seek to prove each of their claims as one of casual negligence, they are entitled to prove them all as outworkings of the same systemic negligence.The applicants have attempted to plead such a "systems" case in the PFASOC.34 It has long been recognised that there is an important distinction between cases of pure economic loss on the one hand and those of personal injury or damage to property on the other.The courts have been concerned not to permit liability in respect of economic loss in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate period to an indeterminate class.Yet that would be the result if foreseeability of economic loss alone were the touchstone of the existence of a duty of care not to cause such loss.Economic loss has a flow-on effect so that the initial loss sufferer and others become potential claimants.35 In Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd v The Dredge "Willemstad" [1976] HCA 65 ; (1976) 136 CLR 529 at [4] all members of the Court, except Murphy J, accepted that there is no general rule that one person owes to another a duty to take care not to cause reasonably foreseeable financial harm (at 555, 558-559, 592, 598).This limitation referred to was recognised by Gleeson CJ in Perre v Apand Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 36 ; (1999) 198 CLR 180 at [4] .In Tame v New South Wales [2002] HCA 35 ; (2002) 211 CLR 317 , the Chief Justice stated (at [6]): One of the reasons for the rejection of a general rule that one person owes to another a duty to take care not to cause reasonably foreseeable financial harm is that the practical consequence of such a rule would be to impose an intolerable burden upon business and private activity.Furthermore, such a rule would interfere with freedoms, controls and limitations established by common law and statute in various contexts [Perre v Apand Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 36 ; (1999) 198 CLR 180 at 192 [4] - [5] ].Unscientific as may be the distinction between 'pure' economic loss, 'parasitic' economic loss, and damage to property, the care which the law requires people to show for the person or property of others is not matched by a corresponding requirement to have regard to their financial interests.The distinction is not based on science or logic; it is pragmatic, and none the worse for that.A similar view was expressed in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ in Sullivan v Moody [2001] HCA 59 ; (2001) 207 CLR 562 at [42] (their Honours' comments related to the tort of negligence more generally, and were not confined by reference to financial harm).36 Apart from foreseeability of economic loss, the PFASOC does not plead facts, which, in conformity with legal principle, give rise to a duty of care owed by Veda.Foreseeability is pleaded in para 11, which is followed immediately by the pleading of the existence of a duty to take reasonable steps in para 12 (which, I note, is substantially the same as para 23).The foreseeability pleaded would support the owing of a duty of care by Veda to any individual, whose name may at any time be entered in Veda's database, since there is the possibility that that person may in the future seek credit from any existing or future subscriber to the Veda system.Counsel for the applicants correctly described at the hearing the duty pleaded as a duty "owed in terms of what's reasonable to every single potential consumer who may be affected by these credit reports." The pleaded foreseeability alone would also support the existence of a duty of care to various associates of such a person, such as his or her creditors, family members and business associates.37 The present case is not one in which Veda had dealings with the applicants and represented claimants in circumstances that might be said to give rise to an acceptance of responsibility by Veda and reliance by the applicants and represented claimants.It is pleaded that the credit reports were requested by Veda's subscribers and provided by Veda to them.This establishes a relationship only between Veda and the subscriber.An undertaking of responsibility accompanied by reliance might characterise that relationship, but that is not this case, which is concerned with the liability of Veda to the applicants and represented claimants.So far as the PFASOC reveals, Veda had no dealings with the applicants and represented claimants.38 It is also pleaded that the credit reports were supplied by Veda to the member with "the permission of the member's own consumer" (in para 7 of the PFASOC) or "with the consumer's permission" (in para 11 of the PFASOC).However, no further facts about the circumstances in which that permission was given by the consumer are pleaded.It is not pleaded whether the permission was given by the consumer to the subscriber or to Veda directly.The giving of "permission", without further dealings, is not sufficient to characterise the relationship between Veda and the consumer as one that might be said to give rise to acceptance of responsibility by Veda towards the applicants and represented claimants, giving rise to a duty of care owed by Veda to them.39 Veda might be said to owe a duty of care to a person applying for credit in respect of whom Veda actually issues a credit report.Although I am not required to express an opinion on the matter, arguably those circumstances would cause a duty of care to arise at that time in favour of that individual who would be "within Veda's sights".That individual might seek to prove a breach of the duty to take reasonable care by reason of Veda's issuing its report based on nothing more than its so-called "honour system".40 The applicants do not, in these class action proceedings, plead their cases on that basis.They propound a duty of care arising from nothing more than foreseeability of economic loss.The authorities establish that that is an insufficient basis on which to found the existence of a duty of care.The existence of the business system alleged by the applicants does not itself give rise to a duty of care to the world of prospective seekers of credit.41 The PFASOC discloses no reasonable cause of action in negligence.42 Taking into account amendments to the PFAA put forward by the applicants at the hearing, the applicants propose the following common questions of law and fact: Proposed common questions of law   (i) Whether the common system of conduct alleged at paragraphs 3-12 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim gave rise to the representations pleaded at paragraphs 2(d) and 16 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim;  (ii) Whether the common system of conduct alleged at paragraphs 3-12 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim, and the representations pleaded at paragraphs 2 and 16 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim are capable of establishing the qualifications and exceptions in s 65A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) to enliven the applications of sections 52 and/or 53 of the latter Act to the respondent's conduct.    (iii) Whether the common system of conduct alleged at paragraphs 3-12 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim gave rise to the existence and content of the duty of reasonable skill and care pleaded and particularised at paragraphs 24(i) and 24(ii) of the Further Amended Statement of Claim.  Proposed common questions of fact   (i) Whether the respondent in trade or commerce throughout Australia at all material times since 12 March 2004 engaged in a common system of conduct as pleaded and particularised at paragraphs 3-12 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim;     (ii) Whether the respondent breached its duty of reasonable skill and care to the applicant and each other group member respectively by the respondent's conduct of an inherently negligent common system of credit reporting, as pleaded and particularised at pars 1-12 2amp; 26 of the FASOC.  43 The claim in negligence might be re-pleaded.A common question of fact might be formulated relating to the breach of the pleaded duties of care owed by Veda to the applicant and the represented claimants.The common question of fact might be generally along the lines: "Did Veda breach the duties of care it owed to the applicant and represented claimants by issuing, without checking or otherwise taking any, or any adequate, steps to ensure that they were correct, credit reports consisting of data recorded in its databank, having regard to the 'honour system' according to which the data were supplied, collected and recorded?".44 Further questions would, however, then arise.There would be a preponderance of non-common questions of fact and law, for example, the question whether the credit report in each case was indeed incorrect, and, if so, whether the credit provider relied on it, and if so, whether the applicant or claimant suffered economic loss as a result.45 For this reason, if I had not granted Veda leave to enter the orders of dismissal but had granted the applicants a further opportunity to replead and they had done so generally along the lines indicated above, apparently it would have been appropriate to make an order under s 33N of the FCA Act that the proceedings not continue as representative proceedings under Pt IVA of that Act.Veda has foreshadowed the making of an application under s 33N if the proceedings should not be dismissed.46 I note that there were numerous criticisms made by Veda in relation to the common questions of fact and law proposed by the applicants.In the light of my conclusion that Veda have leave to enter the orders of dismissal, it is not necessary for me to deal with these further criticisms.CONCLUSION  47 The claim under s 52 of the TP Act cannot succeed and the claim of negligence as pleaded cannot do so.The applicants have had ample opportunity to propound a legally cognisable basis of the duty of care on which they rely as the foundation for their claim in negligence.The applicants should not have an opportunity to replead.48 In each of the nine proceedings, Veda should have leave to enter orders 1 and 2 made on 20 February 2008.In the Knochell proceeding there will also be an order dismissing Ms Knochell's motion brought by notice of motion filed on 5 March 2008.49 The dismissal of the nine proceedings is not a dismissal of any of them following a hearing on the merits.It remains open to each applicant and represented claimant to sue Veda separately.If that were to happen, the court in question could explore means of avoiding the necessity of proof in each case of Veda's business system.I certify that the preceding forty-nine (49) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lindgren.Associate:
