  1 Because the parties and their lawyers cannot agree the combined total of two past applications and two possible future applications, all by consent, and none either complex or unusual, it has been necessary for the Court to sit for a substantial part of a morning in hearing senior counsel for both sides to determine this issue.2 The issue is the proper sum for paragraph 9 of the orders of Rares J on 6 September 2006. United States costs   3 In relation to the United States' costs there is agreement that the appropriate sum for past costs of USD1,145.03.There are contending sums of USD3,625 put forward by Mr Sullivan and USD1,600 put forward by Dr Bell for the possible future consent application.Having read the material from the respective New York attorneys and using my own experience, though not American experience, to understand the steps involved, I think in all the circumstances the sum of USD3,625 is reasonable and that is the sum that should be taken and calculated to create the sum for the purpose of paragraph 9 of the orders.I think it is a more detailed estimate; and I give it more weight because it is of the firm that is likely to incur the costs, though that is not determinative. United Kingdom costs   4 I propose to estimate GBP2,000 for the costs of the discharge.The reasons for the need to estimate is the unsatisfactory nature of the material from the London firm which undertook the application on behalf of the plaintiff.I do not make any personal criticism of the solicitors in this respect.I reject the premise in their estimate that the costs include reading and understanding Rares J's judgment.The costs assume a sound understanding of the orders.I think there was, however, legitimate room for debate about the terms of the consent order that required a certain degree of correspondence between dutiful and co-operative solicitors in London and with their Australian agents and correspondents.There was also the need to take documents to court and the like and a modest amount of consultation with counsel.And I think [sterling]2000 is more than adequate to cover all that. Applicant's costs on an indemnity for all steps necessary for reinstatement   5 Reading the orders against a background of common understanding of the nature of Anglo-Australian courts' approach to orders of a kind made by the High Court of Justice, by way of worldwide freezing orders, it seems to me that it is implicit within the words of the undertaking that the indemnity is for the security for costs which are at the time necessary for the reinstatement of orders, which are of their very nature exhorbitant.6 It is clear from the terms of orders 1(c) and paragraph 9, that Pan is obliged to consent to the reinstatement of the orders, if it loses the appeal.It is entirely likely, however, and indeed, I would expect it to be the case, that something more than a minute of order be filed.It would not be the discharge of the exercise of judicial power that would be dealt with.It would be the reinstatement of the exercise of judicial power.If reinstatement is to occur, there will need to be a collection of material in order to apprise the Court of the state of the matter and the appropriateness of the granting, by way of reinstatement, of worldwide freezing orders.7 The estimate of one London firm of solicitors, on pages 4 and 5 of Mr Wilson's affidavit of the 13th of October 2006, is that this will cost in the order of GBP9,825.Set against that, is the estimate of another London firm of solicitors of GBP500 which I take to be an estimate based really upon an administrative task of the preparation and filing of orders.Though, I do not pretend to be an English practitioner, an English judge or an English taxing master, and I must work on the evidence, I have some difficulty in coming to the conclusion, that it will be necessary in an application of a kind that I have identified, for something in the order of GBP10,000 to be spent.I also have difficulty in accepting that GBP500 will be sufficient.Doing the best I can in assessing that evidence, and recognising that there will be need to inform the High Court of Justice of the state of the litigation, and possibly to brief counsel on that short consent application, I would have thought something in the order of GBP4,000 was more than adequate.8 Mr Sullivan does not wish to say anything against that.Therefore, my conclusion is that the sum of GBP4,000 is a reasonable and appropriate sum for the securing of the application on an indemnity basis for the reinstatement of the orders, recognising that it is security, and not payment of those costs in advance. Costs of today   9 The parties were unable to agree as to what should happen with the costs of this argument.At the hearing I gave extempore reasons which were critical of, the London solicitors for not having agreed to the relevant costs.I invited Australian solicitors to communicate with me if they thought I had been unfair.Ebsworth 2amp; Ebsworth have indicated to me that they thought my comments were unfairly critical of, at least one firm.I therefore, withdraw my remarks about both London firms and replace them with the following.10 The reason why the Court was required to hear argument about a matter that the parties, through their lawyers (London and Sydney), should have been able to agree was either the failure of the lawyers to put forward what I regard as reasonable estimates or the failure to resolve in a sensible fashion the differences between the two estimates.It was therefore necessary for the Court to deal with the issue.Each party should therefore pay its own costs.11 It is the duty of parties and advisers in litigation to limit the call upon court resources to matters truly necessary for decision: Ashmore v Corporation of Lloyds [1992] 1 WLR 446, 453 and see the notice to practitioners for the conduct of Admiralty and maritime work in the Federal Court of Australia dated 21 December 2005, especially the parts emphasised in the relevant portion of such notice, a copy which is annexed hereto.These obligations should be borne in mind and adhered to especially in what might be referred to as hard-fought litigation. I certify that the preceding eleven (11) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Allsop.Associate:
