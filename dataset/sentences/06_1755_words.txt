for purpos rule 
feder magistr court rule cth respond affidavit discoveri shall distinguish document previous produc subpoena document previous produc 
there appear two reason feder magistr reject exist prima faci case 
the first could satisfi beyond reason doubt respond held chain email elsewher possess apart tape januari 
He said direct evid I prepar draw necessari infer evid 
that appear find fact refus find fact rather consid infer would open view evid favour case appel 
furthermor consist view I express regard second charg relat subpoena

the appel solicitor gave evid receiv telephon call respond solicitor septemb say client found januari tape said reason disbeliev 
the feder magistr said clear implic tape recent found 
He satisfi beyond reason doubt evid tape possess custodi control respond juli lost misplac 
In opinion evid appel solicitor could utilis fashion decid whether prima faci case 
the tribun fact would oblig accept hearsay statement respond solicitor even admiss question whether appel solicitor reason disbeliev irrelev issu 
In effect feder magistr found version fact favour respond without proper basi 
In opinion prima faci case email chain avail either tape server time affidavit discoveri sworn file 
the appeal must allow account also 
gener have found prima faci case charg feder magistr went remark upon fail distinctli clearli state charg regard gener handl matter 
No particular fail identifi

I gather said respond counsel rule question result applic respond follow learn feder magistr read r 
feder magistr court rule provid hear evid support alleg court may decid prima faci case dismiss applic 
the effect rule question argu 
I concern requir court rule whether prima faci case motion regardless posit respond 
A respond simpl explan may prefer fight merit avoid interlocutori appeal
