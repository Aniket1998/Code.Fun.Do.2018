further answer letter written act said I man simpl mean sic beaten persecut punjabi sikh jatt land owner 
the tribun wrong assert appel identifi particular social group said member 
the tribun error recognis feder magistr 
howev feder magistr said tribun consid appel claim wider social group group sikh land owner found wider social group subject persecut 
the feder magistr therefor reason tribun assess appel claim 
the feder magistr reason appel live punjab tribun inferenti address aspect claim 
the feder magistr also thought evid relev appel jatt appel therefor differ posit sikh land owner punjab state 
In respect opinion feder magistr er conclud tribun assess appel claim wider social group tribun must therebi assess narrow claim 
that opinion necessarili follow 
the appel claim refuge statu reason member particular social group 
He entitl applic assess claim claim 
If tribun assess claim precis present tribun tribun would determin whether punjabi sikh jatt land owner liabl persecut reason membership particular group
