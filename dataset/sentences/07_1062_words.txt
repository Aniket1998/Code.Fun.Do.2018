the question optu would done project alchemi proceed therefor entir theoret 
Mr lee evid singtel like cours action project alchemi avail optu If project alchemi end februari option avail pursu I would recommend support manag cash option 
In opinion cours singtel would adopt 
If manag cash option adopt I would agre recommend optu agre year agreement take sport channel contain australian footbal leagu 


nation rugbi leagu 


total commit consider million 
In opinion singtel would approv entri agreement manag cash option 
such agreement would involv commit optu larg addit msg type payment wherea manag cash option base minimis expenditur 
although I appreci view submit paul michael ebeid paper consid manag committe meet februari import local content sport channel manag cash option involv attempt attract new subscrib 
the propos sport channel would carri major local sport 
optu alreadi espn sport channel 
commit optu substanti sum sport channel local major sport would contrari manag cash option 
ani loss subscrib absenc sport channel would concern manag cash strategi 
Mr lee press whether optu event project alchemi unavail would continu pursu project emu 
hi respons although board direct negoti austar continu case project alchemi go ahead decis made two altern project emu manag cash prefer 
Mr lee said februari project emu option regard unattract substanc rule mckinsey 
He said project alchemi achiev optu would continu explor project emu manag cash view optu manag would recommend manag cash 
Mr lee point formid obstacl need overcom agreement reach austar 
they includ austar debt million subject restructur discuss problem face optu take advantag tax loss event merger uncertainti link financi model project posit npv basi high termin valu attribut merg entiti 
Mr lee consid time difficulti great optu overcom 
Mr anderson evid effect 
He said februari view merger austar viabl option 
In Mr anderson reiter albeit somewhat defens view I ca persuad I tell firm view 
emu I back depth emu sort problem come date 
sock koong financi control whole group point could transfer tax loss I recal 
there disput arm wrestl whether go sort number anyway equal austar partner foxtel 
there austar debt problem 
So whole rang thing made austar thing start realli work I would difficulti recommend I sure probabl quizz I know I think Mr lee would gone line 
I think Mr anderson evid consist contemporari document reflect accur view time 
Mr lee also evid manag cash strategi would led optu withdraw pay televis industri within short period 
Mr lee accept manag cash strategi design see optu period msg highest 
after open issu whether busi would viabl 
He also accept manag cash option brought cmm close cash flow neutral would made sens optu wait cost reduc final close divis 
nonetheless Mr lee insist februari decis made proceed project alchemi manag view manag cash would lead shut busi time 
Mr lee point strategi involv minimis cash outgo everi way possibl also involv cut capit expenditur take addit pay televis subscrib 
He also point although strategi includ rais price reduc bundl discount optu could know precis effect measur would level churn 
Mr lee reiter manag pessimist view achiev manag cash mckinsey 
In particular manag thought continu cash deficit million million per annum like understood manag cash option success cmm would continu go concern success degre mckinsey model number manag put forth manag paper envisag continu loss million million per annum cash even manag cash option manag view achiev financi implic 
and see clearli put manag paper board 
you understood mckinsey report manag cash option success cmm would continu go concern If manag cash met perform criteria target mckinsey model becom go concern 
If manag cash met manag thought achiev outlin paper put forward optu manag singtel board scenario continu loss million million cash per annum manag thought time best guess futur 
In Mr lee view matter time optu would exit pay televis industri paper singtel board essenti consid option cmm that correct 
each paper reject I suggest exit option option ye immedi exit 
the paper speak immedi gradual they spoke exit ye 
but I would agre but I qualifi read care implic option titl manag cash manag view would like indefinit cash deficit therefor time would continu problemat view time would like lead delay exit busi 
Mr lee challeng aspect evid 
seven contend Mr lee evid Mr anderson hypothet given littl weight given benefit hindsight wit knew interest lay 
the hypothet natur evid fact wit speak benefit hindsight matter taken account determin whether evid accept 
As I note howev evid given Mr lee Mr anderson mean entir hypothet 
In event give due weight matter rais seven I think challeng evid succe 
Mr lee evid seem convinc consist contemporan record deliber within optu 
I therefor accept evid 
Mr anderson adam manag cash polit way say optu would run busi close term better exampl msg commit hollywood studio reduc mistak manag cash way close busi close term disastr term face 
that manag cash 
If go 


mckinsey report see box bottom half box cmm achiev propos busi plan 
that manag cash ye 
they say cmm achiev propos busi plan cmm becom go concern ye 
that correct It correct accord mckinsey 
I know mani busi mckinsey ever run live 
but talk slash capit expenditur capit expenditur way I normal busi reason would think capit expenditur 
In day meant growth 
So talk capit expenditur talk put new ad talk probabl slash program cost much run bare bone talk lose per cent custom year 
My view manag cash alway polit way say end go run close 



W ould agre manag cash differ next altern exit busi It differ realli mean thing 
It matter take snapshot 
manag cash let say manag cash anoth way exit busi phase withdraw msg run 
If look million termin valu I think see manag cash preserv tax loss 
when tax loss run end lose money 
So blind alley 
you go nowher 
you think manag cash exist busi period time manag cash ye well deal manag probabl say run tax loss run back wors state four year 
My view I think back four year ago view fact could last long would lose per cent churn put new custom essenti wait better deal pay much msg exit busi 
Mr anderson view project alchemi open optu futur pay televis busi think cmm futur without content share agreement without rationalis industri 
It small 
It dysfunct 
It subscal 
It high fix cost thing 
It poor program 
So I think gone alchemi also public knowledg everyon known I think could pull alchemi type period go forward I genuin think look back way could got away without close busi 



Do mean close within short time adopt manag cash strategi I meant manag cash 
but I think would meant closur 
I suspect would run three four year whatev manag cash scenario 
I think busi would becom much less viabl much earlier 
emphasi ad 
Mr anderson acknowledg ultim decis relat cmm Mr lee singtel board
