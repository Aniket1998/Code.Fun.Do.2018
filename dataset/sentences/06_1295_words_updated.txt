howev way tribun approach assess claim I think one substanc claim consid 
the tribun realli evalu way appel put forward claim light fact materi put support tribun countri inform

the tribun note question someon might treat return china would depend upon person actual way practis appel put clearli would practic return china 
So true tribun separ identifi consid whether appel would place one horn dilemma seem tribun fail consid claim

while decis maker may view claim differ way tribun tribun satisfi 
I see error way exercis function review affect jurisdict foundat tribun proceed 
I opinion tribun look call dilemma albeit without expressli identifi passag I refer ultim said clear appel would practic falun gong return china therefor could clear tribun whether would affect manner 
the appel also refer decis full court najt v minist immigr multicultur indigen affair fcafc fcr

the tribun evalu seem applic claim basi countri inform

It seem either basi upon said tribun put materi appel must fail 
that I opinion fairli read accord way administr reason read tribun simpli evalu materi regard appel claim express state satisfact base claim 
howev tribun said appel offer littl support claim 
even form evid could give 
the inform tribun take account refer ing littl support claim even form evid could give appear inform reason reject claim part reason inform directli provid appel 
from time time decis tribun refer question might abl ask person attend hear 
the court held specul amount jurisdict error failur compli 
I mind case requir act accord natur justic exhaust came later enact forc time tribun made decis 
thu common law requir procedur fair extent consist act observ tribun addit mandat statut 
I opinion tribun take account fact appel given evid support claim fact attend hear inform would find 
the chief feder magistr thought ground total misconceiv see fmca 
In one sens everi case applic review attend hear part materi tribun failur attend give evid support claim 
but tribun gave reason appel effect given littl support claim given evid support 
At time tribun give notic appel failur give evid support claim would reason reject 
rather sent notic say satisfi materi could make decis favour invit hear requir act could proceed along cours 
To employ appel failur give evid support claim part reason claim accept seem use inform way advis beforehand 
albeit notic tribun go make decis favour given evid 
It tribun satisfi materi present 
the distinct fine difficult I entir sure satisfactori given act envisag purpos invit someon hear enabl persuad say provid hear tribun uphold decis refus visa 
In szezi v minist immigr multicultur indigen affair fca allsop J refer reason tribun given case appel provid level detail necessari satisfactorili establish relev fact case

accordingli honour found case failur compli 
although mind waver point I opinion better view tribun use failur appel give evid view similar fashion 
At end day tribun conclud limit inform avail satisfi appel would risk persecut return china real chanc would persecut 
notwithstand doubt I find tribun oblig give notic I dismiss ground appeal 
should the tribun have tri TO contact the appel when she did not appear AT the hear last said tribun fail exercis discret accord act therebi commit jurisdict error 
the appel argu tribun ought regard fact indic wish attend hear arriv ought taken simpl step telephon telephon number tribun ascertain whether reason 
I ask infer materi appel affidavit unchalleng honour telephon day hear would attend hear made arrang seek adjourn tribun

the minist argu effect facult allow tribun time appel appear enabl appear later altern time sub effect creat consider tribun bound take account exercis discret 
It well known statutori provis confer discret upon term unconfin allow regard rang factor similarli unconfin exercis discret except insofar may found subject matter scope purpos statut impli limit factor may legitim regard see the queen v australian broadcast tribun Ex part pti limit hca clr minist aborigin affair v ltd hca clr per mason J 
mason J went say analog ground review relev consider taken account discret unconfin term statut court find bound take particular matter account unless implic bound found scope purpos act 
the appel say whole purpos scheme act notifi applic review hear tribun enabl heard 
So much may taken grant 
but act also set albeit time exhaust statutori regim notif specifi circumst tribun may move come decis person notifi appear 
there doubt tribun oblig act judici principl natur justic call procedur fair appli extent otherwis qualifi truncat term act exercis discret 
In the queen v commonwealth concili arbitr commiss Ex part angliss group hca clr high court held

the tribun face situat statutori requir notif appel hear take place march observ 
those requir includ requir appel told accord effect 
the appel told letter notifi appoint hear larg mark box block letter attend hear postpon grant tribun may make decis case without notic 
A take one number avail cours commit error exercis jurisdict one cours rather anoth favour person claim affect decis follow 
section gave tribun power make decis two requir section met name valid invit issu applic review appear time appoint hear 
obvious decis concern whether person establish claim entitl protect visa utmost import individu concern 
In real sens decis mean differ life death 
If decis refus visa wrong affect jurisdict error consequ return applic review place persecut fear error realis fear case death 
the serious possibl consequ decis proceed affirm decis persecut fear could suffer opinion part subject matter scope purpos legisl condit way discret fall exercis 
It therefor seriou step tribun decid applic ask appear case said want appear simpli reli without

the evid appeal paper reveal attempt made contact appel fail appear 
So tribun must awar indic wish fact may seriou consequ 
inde passag I refer earlier judgment tribun refer failur give evid support claim matter take account way I describ 
An administr decis involv jurisdict error regard law decis plaintiff v the commonwealth hca clr cite minist immigr multicultur affair v bhardwaj hca clr per gaudron gummow JJ mchugh per hayn J 
In latter case tribun fail drawn attent time made decis commun applic review unabl attend ill 
It later embark review case court upheld exercis ground tribun initi perform review fail regard applic review commun decid accord act 
here act gave tribun discret proceed appel appear march 
the tribun give reason exercis discret act requir 
In minist immigr multicultur indigen affair v szfhc fcafc full court held tribun sent applic review address servic letter invit hear accord ss circumst forc mere fact tribun receiv letter back return sender endors oblig tribun anyth search file see address applic may contact

the respond say circumst tribun oblig search depart file attempt find anoth method contact respond 
He say case tribun oblig contact migrat agent list respond depart file find recent contact detail possibl also ring residenti telephon number contain respond protect visa applic 
the submiss respond respect reject 
In view decis vnaa clear ss migrat act read togeth 
accordingli tribun compli one method prescrib fact two oblig search paper lodg discov might avenu commun applic 
the appel distinguish decis basi matter proceed one stage appel contact indic wish attend hear 
the oblig time appel claim came consid tribun invit appel appear give evid present argument relat issu aris relat decis review 
whether appel took invit seem matter appel end day 
the tribun oblig discharg 
section permit tribun make decis without take action allow enabl appel appear discharg uncontest posit case oblig invit appel appear way conform act 
she appear time place day invit 
while may prefer possibl would decid attempt make contact appel see whether mistak occur act express term authoris tribun 
I think construct oblig tribun accord natur justic applic review appear accord b odd express word discret section 
those word It may make decis review without take action allow enabl applic appear 
It seem quit inconsist word constru oblig procedur fair requir decis maker give applic opportun retriev posit failur appear situat 
I see could impli tribun consid whether contact applic 
the tribun authoris decid 
for evid reveal tribun may consid whether contact appel decid 
again seem possibl jurisdict error could establish 
while seem cours tribun took present case produc unfortun I think unduli harsh result appel I think tribun commit jurisdict error 
I fortifi construct decis greenwood J nbbl v minist immigr multicultur indigen affair fca especi 
the matter may also test consid whether tribun decid make attempt contact appel failur attend march minist could attack conduct ground jurisdict error occur 
It plain tribun discret one way decid whether take action 
I think could infer impli requir procedur fair necessit tribun arriv decis consid contact appel fail whole exercis jurisdict would thrown doubt 
the term section seem negat approach 
I see error way chief feder magistr approach issu 
for reason I reject ground 
other matter I think hard case appel may one minist would wish anxious consid whether light evid misadventur migrat agent realli inform progress statu applic review fact unabl attend tribun discret may enliven proper consider case
