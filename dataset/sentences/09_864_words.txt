nevertheless Mr sweeney QC appear group former client submit court make amend 
section permit court approv scheme arrang subject alter think 
the section circumscrib extent power 
No doubt avail mani circumst 
In Re matin ltd acsr santow J said the discret court larg court would obvious regard whether propos variat novel substanti take vari scheme beyond reason contempl sharehold time agre 
In independ practition network ltd matter independ practition network ltd No fca lindgren J said At least one thing clear court approv subject alter unless satisfi scheme propos alter would still agre requisit statutori major 
A circumscrib approach evid judgment gyle J Re investorinfo limit aclc 
He said alter minor kind realli affect detail scheme court power approv scheme amend 
It present necessari determin outer limit court power amend scheme arrang assum possibl describ limit 
but whatev limit doubt court could remov unreason unfair provis scheme inclus provis might warrant withhold approv provid remain substanti speak scheme member creditor case may agre 
It submit number creditor amend propos resolut made risk scheme may defeat 
I agre submiss 
I therefor posit make amend 
the result posit I must decid whether impugn provis render scheme unfair approv sort winner take approach 
In earlier reason I express concern approv scheme involv departur pari passu rule 
It true liquid point departur pari passu rule may certain circumst justifi 
section contain grow list debt accord prioriti debt insolv compani 
some given prioriti sound polici reason other exist pure polit purpos 
nonetheless parliament chosen debt prefer leav gener bodi unsecur creditor treat equal 
accord Mr sweeney scheme propos least part departur statutori regim 
such departur gener justifi 
As departur may permit see Re hih casualti gener insur ltd nswsc acsr commonwealth v rocklea spin mill pti ltd fca fcr deed compani arrang case 
In case instant scheme true departur statutori regim distribut asset wind 
the reason money distribut creditor put bank 
It true liquid believ potenti caus action bank would get like amount liquid claim never test event liquid view one possibl view 
for part bank contend liabil liquid compani liquid 
So real term money distribut belong bank risk form part liquid asset 
In event liquid seek justifi departur departur pari passu rule basi propos scheme creditor commenc litig must discontinu proceed without order cost henc reimburs cost unfair 
To contrari liquid say provid compens would unfair 
As regard propos payment litig funder liquid say fair creditor enter fund arrang reliev expens may incur commenc conduct proceed 
specif liquid say spate litig issu bank like made contribut decis bank compromis disput put larg sum money go creditor 
In view propos reason circumst 
while amount involv 
million small realiti small proport fund avail distribut among creditor 
If amount divid creditor creditor would receiv addit 
cent dollar 
As regard indemn favour bank provis practic sens applic creditor contempl bring claim advis 
perhap creditor pursu claim 
I doubt mani I think indemn bar 
the liquid point I agre like claim client bring former advis neglig breach contractu duti care possibl mislead decept conduct 
mani claim subject proportion liabil regim 
If advis su would like rais proportion liabil defenc without need join bank 
the posit victoria differ I would refus approv scheme deal might one two action brought state 
anoth point potenti unfair valu releas brought account purpos determin fund distribut creditor 
In earlier reason I suggest may amount confisc client creditor money favour trade creditor 
there two reason longer troubl 
first trade creditor receiv way addit payment minim 
second notion possibl valu client creditor claim larg theoret 
the process valuat one undertaken would complex costli I imagin real benefit achiev undertak task 
final larg number creditor larg major support scheme explain detail effect impugn provis 
while I would defer view creditor clear case unfair scheme patent unreason would wrong disregard creditor view 
mani sophist investor least purpos scheme meet legal advic avail 
thi good exampl scheme reason best judg creditor 
It clear vote creditor prefer take get scheme rather face uncertain risk hazard litig 
I propos approv scheme make order form short minut provid liquid
