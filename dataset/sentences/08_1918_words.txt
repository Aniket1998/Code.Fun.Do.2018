If Mr nicodim use correct figur approxim interest cost would approxim differ approxim 
In opinion determin requir adopt hypothet develop method valuat approach explain Mr brown 
the hypothet develop method valuat premis upon actual cost acquisit cost construct 
the approach taken Mr nicodim matter subject judgement evalu would affect valid valuat 
Mr nicodim misdirect correct valuat approach take valuat properli take account cost fail compli gst act determin
