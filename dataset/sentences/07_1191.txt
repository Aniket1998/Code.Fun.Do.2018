 1 The appellant Tony Cavoli (the Creditor) appeals against a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court which set aside a bankruptcy notice served on the respondent Karl Etl (the Debtor): Etl v Cavoli [2007] FMCA 356.2 The Creditor was an assignee of debt from a firm of solicitors called Lennon Settle Mazzeo Lawyers (the Assignor).The learned Magistrate held at [62] that the bankruptcy notice was an abuse of process.His Honour found at [59] that it had been issued "solely for the purpose of securing payment of the debt".The Creditor had failed to take "appropriate action to otherwise recover the debt or even make demand upon the Debtor" (at [59]).There was, his Honour found at [62], a collateral purpose in that the Creditor and the Assignor had a "contrived arrangement" to circumvent the operation of s 44(3) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth).The Assignor was said to be a secured creditor for a much larger amount.By "syphoning off" a small debt to the Creditor, the Assignor could bring about the Debtor's bankruptcy without having to surrender his security, as required by s 44(3) had it been the petitioning creditor (at [61]).Evidence  3 The debt the subject of the bankruptcy notice was $21,638.30 being the amount taxed by Master Bruce of the Supreme Court of Victoria as the costs of the Assignor pursuant to orders made against the Debtor in the Supreme Court in 2004 and 2005.The Master's Certificate was issued on 18 January 2006.The notice of assignment dated 1 May 2006 was in evidence, although not the assignment itself.The notice of assignment was in these terms:  "To: Mr Karl Etl (aka Karel Etl)  Of: 5 Richardson Street, Essendon    NOTICE OF ASSIGNMENT OF DEBT    ASSIGNMENT OF DEBT Notice is hereby given to you that Lennon Settle Mazzeo Lawyers (formerly Lennon Settle) has assigned to Tony Cavoli all its legal and beneficial rights, title and interest in the Debt in the sum of $21,638.30 plus interest pursuant to statute payable to Lennon Settle Mazzeo Lawyers and arising out of an Order made by Master Bruce of the Supreme Court of Victoria at Melbourne 18 January, 2006.
