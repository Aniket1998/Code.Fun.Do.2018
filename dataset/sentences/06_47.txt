   1 This is an application to set aside orders made by me on 27 July 2005 dismissing the appeal brought by the applicant.2 The respondent submitted that this Court has no power to set aside those orders.I doubt that is so and I am prepared to assume that the Court does have the power.In any event, having regard to the history of the matter and the non-appearance of Mr Khan on several occasions, including today, and for the reasons given by Mr Markus, the appropriate order is to dismiss the application with costs.I certify that the preceding two (2) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Moore.Associate:
