earlier year I hand judgment dealt sever aspect case 
importantli I held first applic colorado group limit entitl maintain registr colorado trade mark respect backpack respond strandbag group pti limit infring mark use backpack 
colorado group entitl maintain registr backpack strandbag group establish colorado group first user mark articl 
I reject argument put colorado group reason use mark backpack also proprietor mark respect bag wallet purs belt 
that argument reject I accept good kind articl backpack 
those find dispos trade mark case 
there still two issu must resolv 
the first whether colorado group entitl claim proprietorship colorado mark respect wallet purs basi first use mark backpack reason later use word relat wallet purs 
the second issu whether colorado group reli trade mark act cth support find strandbag group infring regist trade mark use handbag wallet purs relat bring togeth good benefit custom 
As regard first issu contest first use word colorado trade mark relat wallet purs 
each side claim first user mark respect articl 
strandbag group also altern argument 
It say even predecessor edgarlodg pti ltd first user mark articl nonetheless first user mark respect handbag handbag good kind wallet purs 
both side accept first issu distinct drawn wallet purs 
To resolv disput necessari refer find alreadi made well look evid

I accept argument although I toy earlier reason
