 1 On 20 August 2007, the Court delivered judgment in Walters v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1270 in which the Court dismissed the Application by David Walters and Rhondda Walters (QUD8 of 2006) and upheld the Application by the Commissioner of Taxation (QUD10 of 2006).Because the parties had not made submissions in relation to costs, the question of costs was reserved to be determined.David Walters and Rhondda Walters provided short submissions on 27 August 2007 and the Commissioner of Taxation provided short written submissions on 3 September 2007.2 David Walters and Rhondda Walters accept that there are no special circumstances which would alter the burden of the usual order for costs.Since the Commissioner of Taxation has been successful in both Applications, the Order of the Court will be that David James Walters and Rhondda Isobel Walters are to pay the costs of the Commissioner of Taxation of and incidental to each Application.I certify that the preceding two (2) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Greenwood.Associate:
