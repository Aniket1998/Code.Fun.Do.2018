On view clinic onset veteran osteoarthrosi right hip would need occur later last full year servic plu year make year period plu addit year

He continu activ time servic ceas retir

We therefor find Mr newson meet factor k instrument 
the tribun offer elabor reason confin determin follow issu whether Mr newson knelt squat requir frequenc least two year clinic onset tribun held occur time servic 
the tribun refer least two year appear typograph error tribun presum intend say least two year 
whether physic activ ceas tribun held ceas cessat occur retir

On appeal court commiss submit cl statement principl requir relevantli factor k relat relev servic render person 
Mr newson period elig servic commenc novemb end januari

It made attempt explain Mr newson work two decad discharg subsequ work sydney counti council relat elig servic 
onc clear tribun took respond period employ scc employe account make find 
accord commiss infer irresist tribun overlook cl er law fail take account 
analysi there view fundament problem tribun reason process infect conclus Mr newton meet factor cl j right hip instrument well conclus meet factor cl k knee 
befor deal I would observ import differ factor born mind 
the factor cl j requir lift load least weight bear cumul total kg within ten year period 
In word cumul total may reach within shorter period say five year achiev within longer period say year would suffici 
On hand factor cl k requir kneel squat least one hour day day least two year minimum period may satisfi 
I would read requir requir two contigu year 
As matter construct period refer factor cll j year period k least two year must encompass least part period relev servic requir cl instrument No met otherwis relationship relev servic 
moreov part period relev servic must contribut requir factor case factor cl j total weight lift period greater year case factor cl k kneel squat time requir one two year 
I think tribun recognis need relationship reason 
while tribun observ direct factor cl instrument No substant differ relev term factor cl instrument No term factor cl j instrument No 
If one take last five year Mr newson relev servic start point last year requir factor cl j instrument No factor cl instrument No could met would end year last year requir factor cl k instrument No factor cl l instrument No could met would end two year 
where tribun process reason appear fallen error construct factor cll j k instrument No period year within clinic onset must occur first start 
under current statement principl instrument No clear case factor cll l period year first start immedi follow year lesser period two year period respect 
the tribun view start date factor cll j k previou statement principl instrument No occur physic activ gener kind refer factor lift case cl j squat case cl k actual ceas even cessat occur year expir year lesser period case factor cl j expir period case factor cl k 
henc tribun find Mr newson lift ceas led conclus year period within clinic onset must occur case right hip commenc find Mr newson squat ceas led conclus year period within clinic onset must occur case knee commenc 
In opinion process reason predic erron construct refer physic activ cll j k instrument No 
It refer physic activ gener kind lift squat refer physic activ understood refer back physic activ meet anterior term factor cll j k 
As indic turn requir relev period therein refer year period least two year encompass least part period relev servic provid relationship meet requir cl factor must relat relev servic render person 
such physic activ ceas latest end year period case factor cl j instrument No case factor cl k instrument end two year period word case factor cl j case factor cl k 
So consid differ result applic factor cll j k instrument No result applic factor cll l instrument No 
In fact present case Mr newson meet factor cl j clinic onset osteoarthrosi right hip would occur tribun found occur mid Mr newson meet factor cl k clinic onset osteoarthrosi knee would occur tribun found occur
