for exampl tribun mention parent action european court human right dismiss claim turkish author persecut peopl bring action conclud real chanc would persecut turkish author famili brought action 
further tribun made sever find would least indirectli cover integ claim 
To begin tribun made find risk face peopl hold polit opinion 
It said evid tribun would indic hold imput hold leftist opinion would lead form seriou harm turkey 
It said appel turkish author ongo interest famili link brother brother activ tikko imput involv appel tikko 
later tribun repeat find turkish author interest appel famili link brother brother activ tikko famili member person known leftist milit group
