howev satisfi Ms coe suffer psychiatr ill necessari address matter 
Dr skinner evid the tribun descript Dr skinner diagnosi taken report 
there Dr skinner state Ms coe suffer anxieti disord agoraphobia probabl present prior explos 
howev clear Dr skinner tribun consid anxieti disord clinic condit 
thi seen follow passag transcript MS kelli Dr skinner I curiou I quit follow report page say underli condit depend person 
I understand depend person say underli anxieti condit 
the way I read say prior ye I say disord seem rather shi nervou sort person 
I say everybodi anxieti I thought bit anxiou peopl 



MR vincent senior member kelli ask diagnosi page specif say underli anxieti condit 
As I got answer said anxieti disord ye 
not underli anxieti disord ye 
Is right ye 
well actual said previou paragraph coe suffer anxieti disord well I talk present know answer thi probabl sorri 
thi probabl present prior accid ye I probabl said ye I probabl said tendenc rather present

she describ function better 
Dr synnott evid Dr synnott assess Ms coe march 
He state report describ symptom met diagnost criteria generalis anxieti disord 
He quit unequivoc opinion diagnosi noth explos occur 
In Dr synnott said express view Ms coe generalis anxieti disord due explos would adventur 
He went make slight concess upon Mr vincent counsel Ms coe reli 
I set passag transcript follow I see everyth go sic sort accumul effect bring that I mean know I mean ask would impress incid I ask incid explos I felt I could confid without perhap embarrass later make kind assert 



would fair say would expect major life event would small role somewher would think given I suspect person vulner Ms coe would affect whole rang incid 
now determin much cours would hard I think adventur 





I tri interpret say ye I would think would reason assum Ms coe would affect accid much I know 
now evid I shown realli give much support I would think chanc say would affect 
how much I know know whether effect would still effect quit differ thing 



ye need actual rank would still abl say materi thing like gone pot roll sic well I would thought go say accid would affect would think go affect time

ground failur state find counsel Ms coe submit tribun fail compli aat act 
that provis requir tribun includ written reason decis find materi question fact refer evid find base 
Mr vincent submit diagnosi Ms coe medic condit materi question fact 
He said unclear find tribun made Ms coe diagnosi result breach 
It well establish provis breach failur deal everi argument rais everi possibl 
It enough find reason deal substanti issu upon decis turn way clearli expos reason process dornan v riordan fcr hawkin v comcar fca fcr 
moreov high court observ c migrat act cth similar term aat act requir tribun set find fact make make 
the section mere oblig tribun set find question fact consid materi minist immigr multicultur affair v yusuf hca clr 
It true tribun identifi appropri diagnosi Ms coe psychiatr condit subsidiari issu proceed 
It also true tribun fail express word find diagnosi 
but implicit said Dr skinner evid make find 
It record Dr skinner diagnosi anxieti disord agoraphobia said prefer evid evid Dr dinnen Dr synnott 
In opinion tribun reason accord statutori oblig 
thi issu whether Ms coe psychiatr condit relevantli caus explos 
plainli tribun made set find question fact consid materi decis issu 
It found causat establish reason find prefer Dr skinner evid Dr dinnen particularli analysi Ms coe medic histori consider fact contemporan psychiatr report disclos symptom psychiatr disord

that case decid high court reject test sole determin test causat adopt approach civil case causat determin appli common sens test march v E M H stramar pti limit hca clr 
It may follow littl practic differ ask whether Ms coe employ caus disord whether contribut factor 
As mason CJ said march v stramar plaintiff establish injuri caus materi contribut defend conduct see also chappel v hart hca clr per mchugh J 
It seem read tribun reason fairli sensibl approach task accord statutori mandat 
In view ask whether explos relevantli caus disord consid whether explos contribut factor diseas aggrav acceler recurr 
thi seen two critic find tribun reason 
first prefer Dr skinner evid Dr dinnen tribun consid Dr skinner given proper consider event particularli explos wherea Dr dinnen 
second tribun consid Ms coe anxieti disord time explos symptom would note Dr revai Dr mcmurdo saw 
both find indic tribun ask whether disord present particular period month explos 
In way tribun address question causal nexu contribut factor 
it use term relevantli caus like shorthand full text compens act though doubt would prefer refer directli statutori test 
Ms coe obtain assist Dr skinner diagnosi record tribun reason 
As I said clear Dr skinner consid Ms coe clinic condit explos time prior 
the effect tribun said accept Ms coe clinic disord caus number major life crise explos unrel 
nor concess made Dr synnott assist Ms coe case 
the passag transcript set show Dr synnott conced explos may affect Ms coe 
howev could say much point fact real evid effect nearli two year later 
the observ burchett J dodd v comcar australia ald apt 
hi honour describ concess made medic expert 
He went say destroy doctor opinion balanc probabl continu disabl 
He said the tribun entitl accept act upon doctor opinion doubt 
see also observ spender J wade v comcar fca 
the effect tribun said accept Dr synnott evid insofar support view Ms coe disord relat injuri suffer explos 
In way consid question whether explos contribut factor 
It accept hypothesi 
accordingli I reject submiss tribun fail ask correct question fail consid Ms coe claim dranichnikov v minist immigr multicultur affair hca alr nabe v minist immigr multicultur indigen affair No fcafc alr ff 
Mr vincent argu tribun fail consid submiss worthi consider Ms coe employ contribut factor disord denni wilcox pti limit v commission taxat atr 
In opinion ground review fall head failur address claim 
accordingli I must dismiss 
comcar v mooi the tribun record Mr vincent submiss could make find Ms coe condit satisfi test state comcar v mooi 
In case drummond J said express use src act defin variou form mental condit amount compens injuri appear use technic medic sens
