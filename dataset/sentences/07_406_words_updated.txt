the tribun went explain last observ refer claim traumat event 
It accept scare charg use hma sydney vietnam sometim deton closer vessel caus nois shock expect 
howev said w hat issu Mr fenner claim respons 
the aat refer littl detail Mr fenner report scare charg 
He told one doctor juli first heard engin room know significantli alarm fear ship may attack 
To veteran review board Mr fenner describ particularli fear tet offens 
To aat Mr fenner describ one particularli loud scare charg nearli forc fall thought ship hull hit fear drown boiler room later said happen trip probabl coincid tet offens fifth trip vietnam 
the aat regard inconceiv Mr fenner could recal ask ship attack conclud profess lack recal feign would told incid involv scare charg 
It said first occas hear scare charg may frighten explos would continu produc fear experi 
It note evid wax wane whether worst scare charg incid happen februari trip coincid tet offens 
It said evid reaction scare charg quit unconvinc rang significantli alarm fear life hell scare 
It must said least three observ aat logic 
To know scare charg occur mean experienc subsequ scare charg might also fear attack upon ship 
To expos one dramat nois much greater intens almost knock caus intens fear mean even familiar routin scare charg may time reduc fear particular nois may signal someth wors much wors nois would apprehend routin scare charg 
and fallaci conclud fear would aris abnorm incid subsequ could learn result scare charg 
assum Mr fenner could left post time ask caus find would learn I suspect would obviou enough within minut anyway name ship hit shell 
I also think infer advers credit drawn comparison Mr fenner record reaction abnorm incid warrant 
the descript significantli alarm drawn medic report Dr parker juli doctor report Mr fenner said present verbatim report 
what precis Mr fenner said doctor topic reveal 
the descript fear life appear come Mr fenner formal written statement mani occas believ life danger 
It short statement drawn rel formal term context support observ aat 
the direct quot note said aat scare charg scare hell 
I observ Dr kenni report august record Mr fenner say scare charg scare live shit 
there view materi foundat warrant critic reaction scare charg somehow inconsist therefor unconvinc 
the aat also refer detail Mr fenner report full steam ahead incid 
It critic nomin date incid occur chang 
It also critic recount detail event 
As latter aat set Mr fenner descript event record Dr parker medic report juli veteran review board written statement februari first time date mention februari oral aat first subsequ hear 
Mr fenner first hear aat said pretti sure lead seaman jack pegg told full steam ahead order submarin area Mr pegg statement confirm occas receiv order go full steam ahead 
howev Mr pegg hma sydney februari accord servic record trip hma sydney Mr fenner oper servic vietnam 
the aat describ Mr fenner claim Mr pegg control engin room opportunist fabric 
At second aat hear Mr fenner accord aat said full steam ahead incid happen januari 
the transcript quot aat record Mr fenner say 
last trip I think januari I ca rememb time 
He said hma stuart escorp ship got ping 
He said learn detail got watch ship log say whether got directli pass inform 
In fact copi log page appar januari show hma sydney go full steam ahead eight minut 
subsequ inquiri led aat conclud januari hma stuart report possibl submarin contact hma sydney hma stuart investig hma sydney cruis increas speed alter cours frequent knot rather full steam ahead knot 
also februari return trip vietnam trip hma stuart report possibl submarin contact hma sydney alter cours went full ahead engin 
that order effect two minut suspicion submarin area quickli discount 
the aat assum Mr fenner favour januari way vietnam hma sydney cruis higher speed normal made frequent cours chang one hour order full ahead engin given occas 
It found engin room receiv order engin room telegraph without explan caus order 
after order cancel engin room would told telephon caus order given 
the aat note Mr fenner told Dr parker record report juli fear possibl russian submarin veteran review board fear possibl submarin learnt end watch rumour russian evid first aat hear first made refer suspect submarin russian oral said thought russian second aat hear first said found ping submarin end watch engin room telephon within second fter settl bit 
It said variat evid submarin russian inform convey peopl posit add concern reliabl Mr fenner 
again whilst accept Mr fenner evid variat refer I appreci signific way aat describ 
It accept engin room januari full steam ahead order time 
Mr fenner evid essenc event extraordinari 
It small step conclud Mr fenner said may submarin threat without inform 
when suspicion confirm extent belief russian submarin matter detail undermin signific event 
the aat accept full ahead incid occur 
it concern whether Mr fenner react claim 
how aat use variat conclud contrari claim Mr fenner fear submarin attack accept occas unclear 
the fear Mr fenner claim entir ration one

It follow therefor Mr fenner fear attack full steam ahead incid 
nor occas fear appropri expect degre clariti precis express aat expect especi event relat mani year later 
the aat also took account Mr fenner evid tet offens amount sever stressor claim fear hma sydney vulner shell berth less two kilometr shore 
He press claim anoth sever stressor
