j In second report date june page I state understand time term mount kinabalu patent My understand term mount context guard member would support barrier element posit adjac side wall 
there two aspect term mount 
the first guard element way support connect barrier element would adjac side wall distinct top bottom surfac barrier element 
the second aspect would relat method connect support 
that guard element would mount side wall connect connect structur side wall distinct top bottom surfac barrier element 
I form opinion read kinabalu patent I saw Dr troutbeck affidavit becam awar interpret opinion

p secondli kinabalu patent requir guard member secur mount side wall barrier unit 
thi requir connect side wall 
thi contrast frame assembl guardian wasserstrom system link cabl encircl whole barrier unit 
q thirdli I mention para joint pipe assembl shown draw wasserstrom patent photograph user handbook locat joint barrier unit 
I expect deliber choic design 
the reason I say assembl fit frame assembl connect base plate cabl connect pipe barrier unit could time consum exercis 
I never work guardian unit I believ would difficult assembl highway kit unless barrier unit empti 
thi suggest design mind possibl probabl view assembl pipe would left place move barrier unit 
the pipe would align connect assembl made 
thi would explain pipe stop end barrier unit 
r thi contrast approach kinabalu patent 
claim make clear guard member must extend beyond end individu barrier unit 
the specif I discuss para 
make clear inventor prefer guard member construct segment case guardian wasserstrom disclosur segment extend join end termin midpoint next barrier unit 
thi prefer structur stabil viewpoint would make difficult move barrier unit without first dismantl guard member guard member would extend beyond end individu unit 
howev view kinabalu patent clearli appreci import guard member span joint individu unit from affidavit Dr jenkin continu In para affidavit Dr troutbeck state kinabalu patent direct shield plastic barrier element 
thi one function guard member kinabalu patent also two function I discuss 
I disagre statement Dr troutbeck para affidavit claim kinabalu patent requir joint must resist adjac barrier element pull apart 
In opinion person design barrier assembl made relocat barrier element type subject kinabalu patent would incorpor effect joint design barrier element 
To effect joint design would resist tensil forc adjac barrier element separ whilst still allow flexibl use 
I agre Dr troutbeck statement para affidavit varieti joint known 
I agre Dr troutbeck statement para affidavit 
howev metal pipe forc distribut mean wasserstrom patent mount frame assembl turn mount sens use kinabalu patent requir physic connect achiev composit structur effect side wall barrier element 
In opinion metal pipe shown wasserstrom patent overli side wall barrier element 
In para affidavit Dr troutbeck say illustr wasserstrom patent show metal pipe slightli longer length plastic barrier element illustr 
the end metal pipe coincid end barrier element 
further self evid metal pipe longer barrier element join pipe locat end barrier element must locat place along barrier element join two barrier element 
further metal pipe barrier element longer barrier element barrier element connect barrier assembl long metal pipe connect 
the wasserstrom patent obvious intend joint pipe locat end barrier element 
I believ deliber choic made design wasserstrom system probabl achiev benefit modular 
becaus wasserstrom system concern achiev singl composit structur barrier element guard element oper togeth singl unit design wasserstrom system concern problem two weak point locat posit 
I agre statement Dr troutbeck para affidavit connect metal pipe wasserstrom oper singl structur member 
the essenti point differ wasserstrom system kinabalu patent system kinabalu system guard member barrier element oper togeth singl structur unit

In particular rel longitudin movement possibl metal pipe barrier element 
On evid deal lack novelti opinion wasserstrom patent anticip applic patent

the abstract speak reinforc system highway barrier compris frame structur mount surfac associ highway barrier 
Dr jenkin frequent express view frame assembl secur connect barrier unit 
the frame assembl wasserstrom system secur connect barrier unit 
It follow Dr jenkin view would oper provid composit beam effect way exampl secur connect side wall barrier unit 
In Dr jenkin view It possibl frame assembl longitudin well vertic 
Dr jenkin para express view 
metal pipe forc distribut mean wasserstrom patent mount frame assembl turn mount sens use kinabalu patent requir physic connect achiev composit structur effect side wall barrier element 
Dr jenkin express view 
metal pipe shown wasserstrom patent overli side wall barrier element 
later Dr jenkin express view para the essenti point differ wasserstrom system kinabalu patent system kinabalu system guard member barrier element oper togeth singl structur unit 
thi occur wasserstrom system physic connect metal pipe barrier element 
In view physic connect metal pipe barrier element 
In view wasserstrom patent forc distribut mean mount frame assembl turn mount side wall barrier element 
the suggest Dr jenkin frame assembl mount barrier element way one could say rider mount hors 
that say saddl frame structur sit barrier element physic connect barrier element way rider mount hors physic connect hors 
In opinion closer analog relat relationship saddl hors 
the saddl view secur connect hors mean girth strap cinctur way frame structur consist upper saddl secur barrier element least one cabl connect one side assembl second end connect side assembl 
In sens frame structur secur mount associ highway barrier
