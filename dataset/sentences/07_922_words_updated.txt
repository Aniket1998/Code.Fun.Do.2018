I propos consid whether york street mezzanin discharg oblig Mr dunphi york street promissori note 
If Mr dunphi remain creditor york street mezzanin

the first whether Mr dunphi agre accept discharg york street promissori note payment york street mezzanin ann street mezzanin amount equal face valu note 
the second issu whether Mr dunphi agre payment ann street mezzanin could effect book entri 
the final issu whether arrang found exist set asid ab initio treat never made 
there difficulti first issu 
the answer found rollov applic form 
By accept rollov offer Mr dunphi direct ed york street mezzanin pti ltd 
rollov pay face valu york street promissori note 
thi unmistak direct pay sum due Mr dunphi ann street mezzanin 
If payment made law equival payment direct creditor good discharg debt roper v bumford taunt ER 
As second issu could promissori note discharg book entri rollov accept form silent 
that express agreement payment amount necessari discharg york street promissori note need legal tender 
there may howev implicit agreement effect 
To analys whether parti intend regard follow matter 
first Mr dunphi purpos accept rollov offer purchas promissori note ann street mezzanin 
second achiev purpos pay ann street mezzanin 
third would obviou Mr dunphi york street mezzanin ann street mezzanin compani westpoint group 
fourth instruct pay ann street mezzanin cash 
lastli obviou reason money paid cash 
In opinion albeit good deal hesit payment ann street mezzanin book entri anticip parti implic agre 
even possibl infer agreement Mr dunphi payment book entri conduct would preclud deni exist agreement 
here I mind Mr dunphi accept without complaint issu promissori note ann street mezzanin 
It late Mr dunphi deni york street mezzanin paid promissori note ann street mezzanin paid promissori note issu Mr dunphi 
Of cours conclus efficaci payment book entri depend upon valid agreement express impli york street promissori note could discharg payment book entri deputi commission taxat nsw v P iori son pti ltd fcr 
accordingli Mr dunphi could avoid agreement discharg promissori note book entri payment agreement could set asid ab initio york street mezzanin would still owe Mr dunphi face valu note 
It necessari therefor examin whether Mr dunphi abl avoid agreement 
the first step analysi identifi rather precis done thu far agreement issu 
In broad sens two discreet arrang sprung Mr dunphi accept rollov offer 
the first arrang york street mezzanin Mr dunphi 
prior accept offer york street mezzanin right oblig discharg promissori note matur 
howev offer accept york street mezzanin becam bound discharg note make payment accord direct rollov accept form 
that document state payment made 
No doubt payment made either immedi within reason time accept offer 
york street mezzanin also becam bound pay redempt amount time those aspect arrang york street mezzanin Mr dunphi 
they impos duti upon ann street mezzanin 
nor confer benefit ann street mezzanin 
but due cours arrang Mr dunphi ann street mezzanin come exist 
Mr dunphi direct money paid ann street mezzanin applic sic moni issu pursuant ann street develop inform memorandum agre bound provis inform memorandum 
In opinion amount offer Mr dunphi take promissori note ann street mezzanin rather accept offer issu note 
even assum make rollov offer york street mezzanin also act agent ann street mezzanin noth languag either rollov accept form inform memorandum suggest offer made ann street mezzanin 
nor I consid Mr dunphi enter unilater contract kind discuss new zealand ship Co ltd v AM satterthwait Co ltd AC 
the agreement Mr dunphi ann street mezzanin came exist Mr dunphi offer accept 
At latest ann street mezzanin issu promissori note august 
there may earlier accept Mr dunphi offer fact present known evid earlier act accept cours must commun Mr dunphi

In situat consequ would follow 
first york street promissori note would remain unsatisfi Mr dunphi would still creditor york street mezzanin 
second payment made ann street promissori note Mr dunphi would creditor ann street mezzanin 
In latter connect I note import trade bill exchang includ promissori note prima faci deem made valuabl consider philliskirk v pluckwel S ER crawley v crowther freem ER

thi bring question whether basi upon Mr dunphi might abl set asid agreement ann street mezzanin 
So far common law concern right resciss fraud misrepresent well known need discuss 
there howev one two aspect common law right worth discuss 
ann street mezzanin liquid 
It common ground prior liquid Mr dunphi took step rescind agreement 
thi immedi rais question whether fact liquid bar resciss 
In oak v turquand hard LR HL hous lord held person induc fraud becom sharehold lost right rescind subscript contract upon wind compani even though might entitl earlier 
the reason innoc third parti creditor acquir right would defeat resciss tennent v citi glasgow bank app ca 
In view principl oak v turquand extend person sharehold wish rescind contract compani place liquid 
In southern british nation trust ltd liq v pither hca clr high court refus extend rule oak v turquand debentur holder

It also influenc fact creditor might suppos act face membership

It opinion applic charg creat favour debentur holder case present analog 
citat omit the posit england clear 
initi posit taken oak v turquand appli subscript contract

If resciss common law avail Mr dunphi right exercis oper ab initio ground fraud misrepresent initi invalid act

that explain parti rescind entitl compens loss contract restitutio integrum 
It mean clear whether common law remedi avail Mr dunphi 
even case fraud misrepresent right rescind may lost wrong parti conduct elect affirm agreement 
On discoveri fact entitl rescind wrong parti must elect resciss confirm agreement 
An elect made final revok sargent v asl develop ltd hca clr
