In opinion author limit relev present matter insofar concern gradual worsen impair 
howev west relev reason 
It necessari tribun ask answer seri question 
the first whether applic suffer injuri defin 
the report Dr roth proceed basi injuri lacer right leg suffer injuri subsequ develop cellul 
Dr butler appear proceed basi professor lord 
the tribun also appear accept injuri lacer right leg led condit cellul right leg 
what mean clear 
It may meant tribun view origin injuri either simpli lacer also ensu cellul perhap cellul 
the posit parti tribun injuri cellul 
the medic evid effect cellul inflamm infect soft tissu applic case leg 
the evid point tribun find applic suffer chronic swell infect right leg 
At highest evid person cellul increas likelihood person 
the tribun said symptom suddenli occur 
It appear tribun say symptom cellul suddenli appear applic leg becam infect swollen 
but say applic symptom cellul suffer point cellul 
howev difficulti aris opinion tribun later analysi speak current cellul result two factor exist cellul diabet 
It clear tribun meant spoke exist cellul 
It tribun view cellul condit subsist continu symptomat period 
the second question whether injuri result impair 
It clear tribun consid possibl impair bear mind relevantli address question whether injuri applic suffer result perman impair 
impair defin mean loss loss use damag malfunct part bodi bodili system function part system function 
the applic claim least formul impair least includ partial loss use right leg 
the tribun appear approach matter basi impair damag lymphat system caus origin lacer consequenti infect swell name cellul suffer applic 
the tribun suggest correctli evid professor lord Dr butler point damag lymphat system caus origin injuri 
howev tribun address whether loss use right leg constitut impair defin 
As I understand author particular said west heerey J merkel J J agre merkel J possibl person suffer injuri result loss malfunct manifest differ part bodi time 
there reason principl loss malfunct treat impair 
after hear high court hand reason canut v comcar hca court note textual act assum injuri may result one impair 
the parti declin offer make submiss decis

In opinion tribun er law decis set asid
