In view necessari logic connect two 
for reason I reject afma submiss inform master must actual consid time form mistaken belief reason alert master mistak mistaken belief ration capabl sustain 
did master fail regard inform would reveal mistak It remain consid afma second question form I consid permiss author 
that question master unreason fail regard inform avail time would reveal mistak mistaken belief ration capabl sustain belief In pose second question afma reli upon two item inform say actual avail master time 
they chart au present mitra particularli former show afz borderlin area mitra board b avail taiwanes fish vessel radio contact

inde afma realli suggest otherwis 
the crux complaint master follow precaut cross check gp paper chart radio enquiri anoth fish vessel

In event even master regard australian chart board mitra make radio contact anoth taiwanes fish vessel I consid afma establish would like alert mistaken belief line afz borderlin follow reason first common ground master could read speak english

In particular would realis line fact degre south line realis degre south line shown chart au afz borderlin shown chart au 
howev master evid I accept time realis line shown gp screen degre south line 
for reason I consid even master could identifi afz borderlin chart au would alert mistaken belief line afz borderlin 
c thirdli perhap significantli master use could made australian chart radio enquiri could made taiwanes vessel midnight march 
In absenc I will infer afma say I master could use chart discov mistak could contact someon time night would abl alert mistak 
the unfair draw infer master given opportun explain I obviou
