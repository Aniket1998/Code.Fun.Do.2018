 INTRODUCTION  The first respondent (the State) applies by motion for orders that the Yaburara/Mardudhunera native title determination application be dismissed over the townsites of Karratha and Dampier (the application).The technical descriptions of these towns are annexed as 'A' and 'B' respectively to these reasons.The application is pursued under O 20 r 4 of the Federal Court Rules (FCR) on the basis that no reasonable cause of action is disclosed.The application regarding Dampier is also based on s 84C of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (NTA) on the ground that the application does not comply with s 61A(2) NTA.At the hearing of the application, counsel for the Yaburara/Mardudhunera made it clear that the Yaburara/Mardudhunera no longer pursue the determination of native title over the townsite of Dampier.That leaves the townsite of Karratha for consideration.It also raises the question of what should be done in respect of the presently existing application for native title over the townsite of Dampier.MOTION FOR JOINDER OF PARTIES  In addition to the State's motion for dismissal, there is a notice of motion for joinder of parties to these proceedings.The motion is brought by Violet Samson, Pansy Hicks, Norman Smith, Jim Fredericks, Max Sambo, Kerry Churnside and John Wedge representing the Ngarluma People who are also the applicant in matter WAD 165 of 2008 (the Ngarluma Townsites Claim).The Court has power to join any person as a party to proceedings if it satisfied that the person has an interest that may be affected by a determination in the proceedings and that it is in the interests of justice to do so (s 84(5) NTA).The assertion of native title rights may provide a sufficient basis for allowing respondent party status: Kokatha Native Title Claim v South Australia [2005] FCA 836 ; (2005) 143 FCR 544 ( Kokatha ).Further, a member of a claimant community asserting a competing communal native title right and interest which is inconsistent with substantive native title rights and interests being asserted in the claim may be joined as a respondent under s 84(5) NTA: Rubibi Community v Western Australia [2002] FCA 876 ; (2002) 120 FCR 512 ( Rubibi ).The Ngarluma People contend that their joinder will ensure that their interests would not be adversely affected by a determination in the proceedings without the Ngarluma People having the opportunity to be heard.It would also enable all matters in dispute arising from competing native title claims to the area to be adjudicated upon within the same proceeding if required ( Rubibi at [9]).As there can be only one determination of native title over a particular area, those who claim to be entitled to such rights should be able to become a party to a claim in which the rights may be determined ( Munn v State of Queensland [2002] FCA 486 per Emmett J.Of particular significance to the Yaburara/Mardudhunera claim is the fact that native title has already been determined in favour of the Ngarluma People in the surrounding area.A claim lodged on behalf of the Ngarluma and Yindjibarndi Peoples was lodged with the National Native Title Tribunal (NNTT) on 27 July 1994 and transferred to this Court on 21 November 1996.The Yaburara/Mardudhunera claim was subsequently lodged with the NNTT on 1 August 1996 and transferred to this Court on 7 November 1997.There was a substantial overlap between the Yaburara/Mardudhunera claim and the Ngarluma/Yindjibarndi claim.In the course of the Ngarluma/Yindjibarndi proceedings orders were made by Nicholson J that so much of the Yaburara/Mardudhunera claim that overlapped with the Ngarluma/Yindjibarndi application be heard as part of the same proceedings as the Ngarluma/Yindjibarndi application.The underlying reasons supporting most aspects of the claim at first instance are to be found in the extensive decision of Daniel v Western Australia [2003] FCA 666 , determined on 3 July 2003 ( Daniel ).The four townsites of Karratha, Dampier, Point Samson and Wickham were omitted from the original Ngarluma/Yindjibarndi claim and were therefore not included in the determination but native title in the area surrounding the townsites of Point Samson, Wickham and Karratha was determined as being held by the Ngarluma People.When making a determination of native title in favour of the Ngarluma People and the Yindjibarndi People, Nicholson J also dismissed that part of the Yaburara/Mardudhunera claim that overlapped the Ngarluma/Yindjibarndi claim.As there was no direct overlap between the two claimants in respect of the townsites' area, there has been no specific determination at the precise location of Karratha.The Yaburara/Mardudhunera claim (subject to amendment by deletion of Dampier), covers two of the four townsites (Karratha and Dampier) as well as a substantial further area which does not presently fall for consideration in the State's application.The Ngarluma People are entitled to be joined as respondents.However, in light of my intended disposition of the summary judgment motion, I will make no order at this stage joining the Ngarluma People.The position can be reviewed should their motion be maintained.For the present, I will adjourn the motion with liberty to apply.The argument on the issue estoppel point It is important to appreciate the precise argument on the issue estoppel point.The State argues that: The alternative position of the State is that it is highly implausible that the Yaburara/Mardudhunera People could establish native title over Dampier given that Nicholson J found in Daniel and determined in Daniel v State of Western Australia [2005] FCA 536 (Daniel Determination) that native title does not exist on the Burrup peninsula which surrounds Dampier on all sides.Accordingly, the State argues that the Yaburara/Mardudhunera claim also discloses no reasonable cause of action over Karratha because of findings made by his Honour in Daniel and reflected in the Daniel Determination to the effect that native title to the Ngarluma area surrounding Karratha is held only by the Ngarluma People.His Honour held that the Yaburara/Mardudhunera People do not hold native title to the area surrounding Karratha and dismissed their claim to this extent in the Daniel Determination (Order 24).THE CLAIM  In Yaburara/Mardudhunera's outline of case filed on 23 October 1998, the boundaries of the claim area were illustrated by reference to a map and a description of the boundaries within the longitude and latitude coordinates there described.For present purposes it is not necessary to identify with precision the detail of the area of the claim.It suffices to say that the claim included the Dampier townsite, the Karratha townsite, an area seaward to the west and the north of those townsites and substantially to the south.In total, the area was some hundreds of square kilometres and very substantially more than the two townsites mentioned.It was said that the land and waters claimed were part of the traditional homelands of the Yaburara and Mardudhunera Peoples; that the ancestors of the Yaburara and the Mardudhunera Peoples, both at the time of sovereignty and the time of contact with various Europeans in the 1800s occupied and resided on the land claimed; camped on it; travelled over it; travelled over the waters; hunted on the land; fished in the waters; foraged for food on the land claimed and for shellfish on the edge of the waters claimed; quarried and knapped stoned on the land claimed; dug for ochre on the land claimed; made tools and weapons with raw materials found on the land claimed; made shelters on the land claimed from raw materials found on the land claimed; educated and guided their children with regard to ownership of the land and other matters; placed etchings and paintings of cultural significance on the rocks and trees on the land claimed; conducted ceremonies and rituals with regard to the birth and death and different life stages of members of the society; enjoyed recreation on the land and waters claimed; created and maintained sites of spiritual and cultural importance; cared for and maintained the land the subject of the claim; prepared medicines and religious artefacts from materials found on the land; used the Yaburara and the Mardudhunera languages which belonged exclusively to the area; gave names to landmarks on the land claimed in the Yaburara and Mardudhunera languages; asserted ownership of the land and waters claimed as against members of other language groups; resisted invasion and settling of the claimed land and waters by Europeans; conducted trade and commerce with other language groups around the claimed land and waters; and burned the land claimed for hunting and other reasons.In the following year certain amendments were made to the claim area and other features of the claim.It is to be noted that although the original claim relies upon connections to the claim area held by both the Yaburara People and the Mardudhunera People, the manner in which the case was presented in Daniel was somewhat different.As will be seen from the summaries of evidence and findings appearing below, in Daniel essentially the claim in relation to the Burrup was pursued on behalf of the Mardudhunera People who claimed their link to the land through the Yaburara People.That claim failed as Nicholson J found in Daniel that the Yaburara People or any other group were not in occupation of the Burrup beyond a period early in the Twentieth Century.The State argues that no other basis has been advanced to support the Yaburara claim in Daniel .It is unclear whether the balance of the overlap area was claimed by the Yaburara/Mardudhunera People as Yaburara or Mardudhunera or partly Yaburara and partly Mardudhunera or joint Yaburara/Mardudhunera.Nevertheless, Nicholson J observed at [352] of Daniel that those of the Yaburara/Mardudhunera who claimed to be Yaburara had not established that to be the case and that evidence supported the view that the Yaburara/Mardudhunera claimed as Mardudhunera.Nicholson J then went on to consider whether the Yaburara/Mardudhunera, being Mardudhunera, had continuity as a group since sovereignty.At [375] and [501] Nicholson J found that although the Mardudhunera group had held the requisite continuity since sovereignty, the evidence did not establish that the Mardudhunera had exercised the remaining two rights found to be presently observable continuously back to sovereignty.On that basis, Nicholson J found that no requisite connection was established and that even if they had connection at the time of sovereignty, it had not survived the passage of time.The State contends that it would be inherently implausible that, within the relatively small area of the townsite of Karratha, the situation were somehow different from the entirety of the area surrounding Karratha and which was closely examined in Daniel .CONCESSION CONCERNING DAMPIER  Counsel for the Yaburara/Mardudhunera conceded that the Dampier townsite could not be claimed primarily on the second ground when, in the course of argument, he said:   We maintain the position that if it is true that the special leases over the townsite at [Dampier] alienate the land, then it brings within the exception that appears in our claim and it's not claimed.So we would invite your Honour, in the light of my friend's evidence and in the absence of our opposition and subject to whatever else might be said to you, to find accordingly that that land is alienated, and that would then take it clearly out of our claim.  While the concession of counsel was confined to the alternative basis raised by the State pursuant to s 84C NTA, for the reasons which follow and which are primarily directed to the Karratha townsite (although to some extent distinguishing between small locations on the European boundary bases is artificial), I would have reached the same conclusion in respect of Dampier, not only on the secondary argument of the State but also on the primary argument as I did in relation to Karratha.PRINCIPLES GOVERNING DISMISSAL  The application by the State is made pursuant to O 20 r 4 FCR which is in the following terms:   4 Stay or dismissal (proceedings commenced before 1 December 2005)     (1) This rule applies to a proceeding commenced before 1 December 2005 if the Court is satisfied that, for the proceeding generally or for a claim for relief in the proceeding:      (a) no reasonable cause of action is disclosed; or (b) the proceeding or claim is frivolous or vexatious; or (c) the proceeding or claim is an abuse of the process of the Court.     (2) The Court may order that the proceeding be stayed or dismissed generally or in relation to the claim for relief.(3) The Court may receive evidence on the hearing of an application for an order under subrule (2).  Those terms are substantially similar to O 20 r 2 FCR which was repealed in the amendments to the Rules made in 2007.There is no reason to believe that the principles applicable to the current form of the Rule are any different from those applying to the Rule in its previous terms.No party has suggested otherwise.The amendment to the Rules occurred on the introduction of the provisions for summary judgment contained in s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (FCA).That section lowered the bar for summary dismissal but it is important to note in these proceedings that it is O 20 r 4 FCR which is the basis of the State's motion.That is the appropriate provision because the Yaburara/Mardudhunera claim was lodged with the Registrar of the NNTT on 1 August 1996.It was transferred to this Court on 10 November 1997.Such an application is a proceeding in the Federal Court (s 13(1) and s 61 NTA and Phillips v State of Western Australia [2000] FCA 1274 at [8] ).APPROPRIATE PRINCIPLES FOR DETERMINING WHETHER 'NO CAUSE OF ACTION' IS DISCLOSED  The principles are well established and warrant repetition only to reinforce the high level that is to be satisfied in a motion such as the present.The principles are conveniently collected in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91 per Dixon J (as his Honour then was) and in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 per Barwick CJ at 128-130.From the principles there stated it is clear that no court proceeding should be summarily dismissed except in a very clear case.The General Steel test as explained by Barwick CJ at 129 is that:   The test to be applied has been variously expressed; "so obviously untenable that it cannot possibly succeed"; "manifestly groundless"; "so manifestly faulty that it does not admit of argument"; "discloses a case which the Court is satisfied cannot succeed"; "under no possibility can there be a good cause of action"; "be manifest that to allow them" (the pleadings) "to stand would involve useless expense".  If there is a real question of fact or law to be determined and the rights of the parties depend upon it, a proceeding should not be summarily dismissed.It does not follow from this collection of principles that it is only in blindingly obvious cases that summary dismissal should be ordered.The fact that detailed argument may be necessary to highlight the basis of the contention should not be determinative of the issue.The High Court reiterated over forty years later in Webster v Lampard [1993] HCA 57 ; (1993) 177 CLR 598 (Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ) (at 602) that:   The power to order summary judgment must be exercised with "exceptional caution" ... and "should never be exercised unless it is clear that there is no real question to be tried".  The Court should have regard to the version of facts most favourable to the applicant but this does not mean that every fact pleaded has to be accepted.Were it otherwise, an issue estoppel argument could never be relied upon (and it has), to justify summary dismissal.The summary judgment principles have been applied in the context of native title determinations on a number of occasions.In Moran v Minister for Land 2amp; Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [1999] FCA 1637 Wilcox J dismissed proceedings for lack of authorisation (at [44]-[48]).In Williams v Grant [2004] FCAFC 178 the Full Court (North, Dowsett and Lander JJ) (at [48]-[49] also on an authorisation basis); Bodney v Bropho [2004] FCAFC 226 ; (2004) 140 FCR 77 (at 88-89, at [50]-[51] where Stone J examined the Senate debate on the topic of summary judgment); Walker on behalf of The Noonukul of Minjerrabah v State of Queensland [2007] FCA 967 (at [17]-[18] again for lack of authorisation); and Van Hemmen on behalf of The Kabi Kabi People #3 v State of Queensland [2007] FCA 1185 (at [8] and, again, for lack of authorisation).Most recently in Quall v Northern Territory of Australia [2009] FCA 18 the claim was struck out for reasons which will be examined below in more detail but are presently pertinent.ISSUE ESTOPPEL  The leading case remains Blair v Currun [1939] HCA 23 ; (1939) 62 CLR 464.Dixon J at (531-532) said of issue estoppel that:   A judicial determination directly involving an issue of fact or of law disposes once and for all of the issue , so that it cannot afterwards be raised between the same parties or their privies.The estoppel covers only those matters which the prior judgment, decree or order necessarily established as the legal foundation or justification of its conclusion, whether that conclusion is that a money sum be recovered or that the doing of an act be commanded or be constrained or that rights be declared.(emphasis added)  In other words, an issue estoppel is created in relation to any issue of fact or law that is legally indispensable to a prior decision involving the same parties.In Carl Zeiss Stiftung v Rayner 2amp; Keeler Ltd [No.2] [1967] 1 AC 853 , Lord Guest noted that the doctrine of issue estoppel had been accepted by Australian courts for a number of years and indicated that, for the doctrine to apply in a later set of proceedings, the requirements were:   (1) that the same question has been decided; (2) that the judicial decision which is said to create the estoppel was final; and, (3) that the parties to the judicial decision or their privies were the same persons as the parties to the proceedings in which the estoppel is raised or their privies.  Quall Before considering the application of those principles in a number of cases, it is necessary to consider a recent similar case.In the recent decision of Quall [2009] FCA 18 , an order similar to that now sought was made by Reeves J.In Risk v Northern Territory of Australia [2006] FCA 404 ( Risk ), parts of native title determination applications relating to a particular area near Darwin described as being 'Area A' had been consolidated into one set of proceedings.The second native title applicant in those proceedings, Mr Quall (on behalf of the Danggalaba and Kulumbiringin People), alleged the existence of a particular Aboriginal society that held native title.However, Mansfield J held, (as did Nicholson J in this case) that a different society to the one alleged by Mr Quall was the relevant society which held native title at sovereignty.His Honour held that society had ceased to hold native title due to a 'substantial interruption' in the observance of traditional laws and customs in the Twentieth Century.Claims over Area A were therefore dismissed.On the motion before Reeves J the Northern Territory applied to dismiss the balance of the Quall native title application.The balance of that application related to an area of land termed Area B.It was not the land which had been the subject of dismissal in Risk .Mr Quall argued the existence of the same society as asserted in Risk (as the Yaburara/Mardudhunera are arguing in this proceeding) and alternatively, the existence of another different society that he had not asserted in Risk but he had asserted unsuccessfully on appeal in Risk (on behalf of Larrakia People) v Northern Territory and Others (No NTD 5 of 2006) [2007] FCAFC 46 ; (2007) 240 ALR 75.It was held that to the extent the applicants relied on the same society they had asserted in Risk in relation to Area A, they were estopped from doing so because the continued existence of that society had been determined adversely and therefore there was an issue estoppel.His Honour also held that to the extent that the applicants proposed to rely on a different society to that asserted in Risk , they were also estopped from doing so because the society 'issue' had been determined (adversely against them, in effect, in Risk ) ( Quall at [99]).The Court took the view that it did not matter that a different area was involved (at [98] and [115]) nor that the alternative society argument had not been considered and determined in Risk (at [97]).It was held that it was an abuse of process to argue that a different alternative society existed in relation to Area B.At [115] his Honour said:   As I have already observed above, I consider the findings made by Mansfield J in Risk are in clear terms and they deal directly with the various components of the definition of native title in s 233 of the NT Act, as explained by the High Court in Yorta Yorta .Those findings followed an exhaustive examination of a large body of evidence and they resulted in the final orders made by Mansfield J to the effect that native title does not exist for Larrakia lands in Area A (see [43] above).In my view, the findings and orders of Mansfield J are final, in the sense that they foreclose on any other Aboriginal society being able to establish that the laws and customs under its normative system gave rise to rights and interests in Larrakia lands in Area A.Indeed, they constitute a judgment in rem that no native title exists in those lands (see the cases set out in [63] above).While the decision in Risk does not have the same status in relation to the lands in Area B, I do not consider that detracts from the final effect of the findings on the ultimate issues upon which that decision is founded.Specifically, that the Larrakia peoples were the relevant Aboriginal society at sovereignty that possessed rights and interests in Larrakia lands.I consider this constitutes a final finding as to the relevant Aboriginal society that possessed rights and interests in those lands whether they fell within Area A or B.  Nicholson J concluded in Daniel (at [370]-[371] and see also Moses v Western Australia [2007] FCAFC 78 ; (2007) 160 FCR 148 ( Moses ) at [281]-[284] and [349]) that the only society holding native title over the Ngarluma native title area at sovereignty and at present was and is the Ngarluma society.That conclusion was reached following examination of extensive evidence.Was the determination of the status of the Yaburara/Mardudhunera essential to the determination of the native title question?After exhaustive analysis, Nicholson J in Daniel concluded that the Yaburara/Mardudhunera as Yaburara could not establish native title over the Burrup and that the Yaburara/Mardudhunera did not hold native title in the area surrounding Karratha as the Mardudhunera group did not have the requisite connection with the claim area.To appreciate the significance of the conclusion (in order to determine whether the Yaburara/Mardudhunera is issue estopped), it is necessary to consider what it was that Nicholson J had to determine in Daniel .Section 223 NTA relevantly provides that 'native title' or 'native title rights and interests' means:   ... communal, group or individual rights and interests of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders in relation to land or waters, where: (a) the rights and interests are possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged, and the traditional customs observed, by the Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders; and (b) the Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders, by those laws and customs, have a connection with the land or waters; and (c) the rights and interests are recognised by the common law of Australia.  The statutory definition in s 223(1) NTA is clearly the crucial question and the starting point.In De Rose v South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110 ; (2005) 145 FCR 290 (at [38]), the Full Court said:   It is hardly likely that the traditional laws and customs of Aboriginal peoples will themselves classify rights and interests in relation to land as "communal", "group" or "individual".The classification is a statutory construct, deriving from the language used in Mabo (No 2) .If it is necessary for the purposes of proceedings under the NTA to distinguish between a claim to communal native title and a claim to group or individual native title rights and interests, the critical point appears to be that communal native title presupposes that the claim is made on behalf of a recognisable community of people, whose traditional laws and customs constitute the normative system under which rights and interests are created and acknowledged.That is, the traditional laws and customs are those of the very community which claims native title rights and interests.By contrast, group and individual native title rights and interests derive from a body of traditional laws and customs observed by a community, but are not necessarily claimed on behalf of the whole community.Indeed, they may not be claimed on behalf of any recognisable community at all, but on behalf of individuals who themselves have never constituted a cohesive, functioning community.  In Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria [2002] HCA 58 ; (2002) 214 CLR 422 , Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ said after observing that native title has its origin in the traditional laws acknowledged and the customs observed by the indigenous people who possess the native title, that native title is neither an institution of the common law nor a form of common law tenure but is recognised by the common law.Their Honours asked (at [31]):   ...Is it a body of traditional law and custom as it existed at the time of sovereignty?Is it a body of law and custom as it exists today but which, in some way, is connected with a body of law and custom that existed at sovereignty?How, if at all, is account to be taken of the inescapable fact that since, and as a result of, European settlement, indigenous societies have seen very great change?  And continued to note (at [33]) that:   ..."Native title" means certain rights and interests of indigenous peoples.Those rights and interests may be communal, group or individual rights and interests, but they must be "in relation to" land or waters.The rights and interests must have three characteristics.The first is that they are possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the peoples concerned.That is, they must find their source in traditional law and custom, not in the common law....   Further, the Court said (at [34]) that:   ...the rights and interests must have the characteristic that, by the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the relevant peoples, those peoples have "a connection with" the land or waters.Again, the connection to be identified is one whose source is traditional law and custom, not the common law.  And, (at [35]) that the rights and interests in relation to land must be 'recognised' by the common law of Australia.Native title rights and interests to which the NTA refers, the Court reinforced, are rights and interests finding their origin in pre-sovereignty law and custom, not rights or interests which are a creature of that Act.Then, coming to the current issue, the Court said:   51 What is the position if, as is said to be the case here, the content of the laws and customs is passed on from individual to individual, despite the dispersal of the society which once acknowledged and observed them, and the descendants of those who used to acknowledge and observe these laws and customs take them up again?Are the laws and customs which those descendants acknowledge and observe "traditional laws" and "traditional customs" as those expressions are used in the Native Title Act , and are the rights and interests in land to which those laws and customs give rise possessed under traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed?    52 Again, it is necessary to consider the several elements of the issues that thus arise.Has the society ceased to exist?Does not the survival of knowledge of the traditional ways suggest that it has not?Or is it shown that, although there is knowledge, there has been or is no observance or acknowledgment?These may be very difficult questions to resolve.Identifying a society that can be said to continue to acknowledge and observe customs will, in many cases, be very difficult.In the end, however, because laws and customs do not exist in a vacuum, because they are socially derivative and non-autonomous, if the society (the body of persons united in and by its observance and acknowledgment of a body of law and customs) ceases to acknowledge and observe them, the questions posed earlier must be answered, no.    53 When the society whose laws or customs existed at sovereignty ceases to exist, the rights and interests in land to which these laws and customs gave rise, cease to exist.If the content of the former laws and customs is later adopted by some new society, those laws and customs will then owe their new life to that other, later, society and they are the laws acknowledged by, and customs observed by, that later society , they are not laws and customs which can now properly be described as being the existing laws and customs of the earlier society.The rights and interests in land to which the re-adopted laws and customs give rise are rights and interests which are not rooted in pre-sovereignty traditional law and custom but in the laws and customs of the new society.  AN ADVERSE FINDING TO THE YABURARA/MARDUDHUNERA WAS MADE IN DANIEL  In addition to advancing some arguments of his own for the Yaburara/Mardudhunera, Counsel for the Yaburara/Mardudhunera has adopted the submissions of senior counsel for Wong-Goo-TT-OO to which I have referred in the reasons for decision in Wong-Goo-TT-OO (WAD 6256 of 1998).An application in Wong-Goo-TT-OO in similar terms to the current application was argued concurrently with this application.It is therefore necessary to consider an important aspect of that argument in which it was contended that no relevant 'finding' was made by Nicholson J in Daniel that is capable of operating as an issue estoppel.The most important issue in the present debate is whether Nicholson J relevantly made a 'finding' in terms for which the State contends.If there was no ultimate finding, there can be no issue estoppel.Although issue estoppel can operate as to fact and to law, it must be an issue for the doctrine to arise.Simply to discard one aspect of a claim would not raise an issue for the purposes of issue estoppel.Frequently a party may fail or succeed on one aspect of a claim while having a different result on others.On this issue, the Yaburara/Mardudhunera, like Wong-Goo-TT-OO in the related application relied heavily on Kuligowski v Metrobus [2004] HCA 34 ; (2004) 220 CLR 363 at [60] and particularly the passage reading:   A failure to find a matter alleged does not establish the truth of the contrary of that which is alleged.There are many general statements about the operation of issue estoppel, approved in this Court, which require more than non-satisfaction to establish an estoppel in later proceedings.  However, this passage without amplification does not assist.In Kuligowski , Metrobus wished to contend that Mr Kuligowski was issue estopped from advancing a common law negligence claim in respect of an ankle injury sustained at work and in respect of which a second review officer had, for workers' compensation purposes, recorded the following:   It is also necessary for the applicant to prove incapacity for work and in this regard I am of the view that Mr Kuligowski has not satisfied the onus upon him on this point.  The ratio of the decision in Kuligowski appears before the heading 'Immaterial Matters' in which the passage on which the Yaburara/Mardudhunera wish to rely is to be found.The ratio of the decision is at [45]-[46] in which the Court held that the second review officer had a different question to decide from the question which might confront the District Court on a common law claim.Notwithstanding that difficulties may be encountered in the common law claim in light of the conclusions reached by the second review officer, the matters which that officer had to decide were different from those which would arise on the common law claim.The reasoning of the High Court makes it clear that the proper approach to determining what has been decided in a matter can only be assessed having regard to the pleaded and argued issues.Plucking a sentence out here or there does not answer all the questions.The comments made by the Court on which the Yaburara/Mardudhunera rely appear under the heading 'Immaterial Matters' as part of a collection of other issues which arose and on which, in the circumstances, it was unnecessary to decide.The full paragraph in which the sentence on which the Yaburara/Mardudhunera relies reads as follows (footnotes omitted):   In general, disbelief in a witness's evidence does not establish the contrary.Similarly, disbelief in the case presented by the moving party does not necessarily permit the court to conclude that the positive case of the opposing party is correct.In particular cases it may not be possible to reach a conclusion either way:      "[T]he judge is not bound always to make a finding one way or the other with regard to the facts averred by the parties.He has open to him the third alternative of saying that the party on whom the burden of proof lies in relation to any averment made by him has failed to discharge that burden."      A failure to find a matter alleged does not establish the truth of the contrary of that which is alleged.There are many general statements about the operation of issue estoppel, approved in this Court, which require more than non-satisfaction to establish an estoppel in later proceedings.  As the Court explained at [61], in finding whether or not something has been solemnly found against a party, the form of the first proceeding, particularly the issues joined or admitted on the pleadings will be important.In other words, as Dixon J observed in Blair v Curran [1939] HCA 23 ; 62 CLR 464 (at 532):   [J]udicial determination concludes, not merely as to the point actually decided, but as to a matter which it was necessary to decide and which was actually decided as the ground work of the decision itself, though not then directly the point at issue.  More importantly for present purposes, Dixon J went on to distinguish findings concerning only 'evidentiary facts' rather than the 'ultimate facts' which found the very title to rights in dispute.In Kuligowski , however, the High Court observed that that important issue was not the subject of the primary submissions of the parties and was not necessary to decide in the present case so was put to one side.In Kuligowski , the High Court referred to the decision in the Privy Council which upheld the dissenting judgment of Higgins J in Hoysted v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1921] HCA 56 ; (1921) 29 CLR 537.In Hoysted , Higgins J had referred to the use of the phrase 'actually litigated and determined' - in turn, an expression coined by the Supreme Court of the United States in Cromwell v County of Sac [1876] USSC 62 ; (1876) 94 US 351 at 353.Higgins J observed in Hoysted that the particular point (in relation to joint ownership for the purposes of land tax) was by virtue of the formal objections and from the nature of the judgment 'actually litigated and determined' in the former proceedings and that whether the judgment in its actual form was due to the Commissioner's consent or admission or to his neglect, he is bound by the finding of joint ownership which the judgment necessarily involves.In Kuligowski , the High Court went on to say that in the proceedings under the Workers' Compensation and Rehabilitation Act 1981 (WA), no findings were made which operated in the manner alleged as issue estoppels nor was the structure of the legislation in the nature of the proceedings such that there could be said that the necessary findings must be treated as having been actually litigated and determined.Unlike Kuligowski , in the present case it is central to the issue estoppel argument to determine whether or not Nicholson J made findings on the topic of whether the Yaburara/Mardudhunera had the ability to hold native title as a group.A number of cases have considered the passage in the joint High Court judgment in Kuligowski where the Court says that a failure to find a matter alleged does not establish the truth of the contrary of that which is alleged (at [60]): Commonwealth of Australia v Cockatoo Dockyard Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 322 ; DP World Australia Ltd v Fremantle Port Authority [2009] WASCA 16 ; Lancee v Willert [2008] WASCA 120 ; Wyatt v MR and RC Smith Pty Ltd [2008] WASCA 55 ; Squires Transport Pty Ltd v Turnor [2004] WASCA 245.One of the decisions cited in Kuligowski was Egri v DRG Australia Ltd (1988) 19 NSWLR 600 , a decision of the Court of Appeal of New South Wales in a Court constituted by Mahoney, McHugh and Clarke JJA.(McHugh JA was also a member of the Court in Kuligowski ).In Egri , the Court of Appeal upheld a conclusion by the primary judge that there had been an issue estoppel by virtue of the primary judge having said 'I am not satisfied that the theory of the disc lesion has been established...I am not satisfied that the injury has resulted in disc lesion'.The approach taken by the Court of Appeal as is evident from the judgment of McHugh JA was that unlike the case of Lombardo v Stuart Bros Pty Ltd (1967) 68 SR(NSW) 159 (and I might say, unlike Kuligowski ), the finding relied upon for an issue estoppel in Lombardo as to an infarction was not an indispensable step in making the ultimate findings.However, in the case of Egri , the finding that there was no disc lesion was fundamental in determining what was the nature of the injury and whether the worker was still incapacitated (at 605).It was because of the fundamental nature of what was being decided as distinct from the language employed that an issue estoppel was created.Even in Blair v Curran [1939] HCA 23 ; 62 CLR 464 , Dixon J (as he then was) observed at (at 531-532) that the essential task is to distinguish between those matters fundamental to the decision or necessarily involved in its legal justification or foundation from matters which are not in point of law the essential ground work of the conclusion.Indeed, in Egri , it was argued that because there had been no positive finding as to a failure to establish on balance of probabilities the existence of a disc lesion that the conclusion reached was insufficient to create an estoppel.That submission was expressly rejected in Egri (at [601F], [604D], [608D]).The Yaburara/Mardudhunera advance the same argument in this proceeding, that a negative conclusion such as not being satisfied, cannot constitute a finding.The argument should be rejected as it was in Egri .The High Court in Kuligowski says that in relation to ultimate facts which form the very title to rights in dispute would it require more than non-satisfaction.I take this to be indicating that conclusions reached about ultimate facts as distinct from evidentiary facts must necessarily be findings.That does not necessarily conflict with the observation that a failure to find a matter alleged does not establish the truth of the contrary of that which is alleged.As all the cases indicate, it is a matter of examining the real issues in dispute, the task for the Court, and the basis on which the Court arrived at its conclusion in order to assess whether a determination is, for the purposes of an issue estoppel, in the nature of an ultimate finding, however it may have been expressed.One example of the cases in point is Wyatt v MR and RC Smith Pty Ltd in which Buss JA with whom Wheeler JA and Pullin JA agreed, said:   42 It is essential, in examining reasons for decision which are alleged to create an issue estoppel, to understand with precision what the judicial officer was required to determine.See Murphy v Abi-Saab (1995) 37 NSWLR 280 , where Gleeson CJ (with whom Kirby P and Rolfe AJA agreed) said:      The difficulty is to distinguish between decisions of fact or law fundamental or cardinal to the judgment and other decisions.One thing, however, is clear.Only a decision about a matter which it was necessary to decide can create an issue estoppel.It is, therefore, essential to approach reasons for judgment which are said to create an estoppel with an accurate understanding of what the author of the reasons was required to decide (288).     ... 46 In Kuligowski , the High Court noted that in some cases it may not be possible for a court or tribunal to reach a conclusion either way in relation to a specific issue [60], and cited the following passage from the speech of Lord Brandon of Oakbrook in Resa Shipping Co SA v Edmunds [1985] 1 WLR 948:      [T]he judge is not bound always to make a finding one way or the other with regard to the facts averred by the parties.He has open to him the third alternative of saying that the party on whom the burden of proof lies in relation to any averment made by him has failed to discharge that burden (955).     The High Court then said that a failure to find a matter alleged does not establish the truth of the contrary of that which is alleged.Their Honours added:      There are many general statements about the operation of issue estoppel, approved in this Court, which require more than non-satisfaction to establish an estoppel in later proceedings [60].   WAS KARRATHA AFFECTED BY THE ISSUES DETERMINED IN DANIEL? The question is whether the findings reached in the Daniel litigation also mean that the Yaburara/Mardudhunera People are precluded from pursuing a claim in native title over the only remaining area relevant to the current application, namely, the townsite of Karratha.To decide this question, it is necessary to trace not only the history of the claim but also its resolution.The Yaburara/Mardudhunera native title determination application was first lodged with the NNTT on 1 August 1996.It included land that was already under claim by the Ngarluma/Yindjibarndi People in WAD 6017 of 1996 and land which was later claimed by the Wong-Goo-TT-OO People in WAD 6256 of 1998.The map which is annexed and marked 'C' depicts the Yaburara/Mardudhunera claim area vis a vis the Ngarluma/Yindjibarndi and Wong-Goo-TT-OO claim areas.To the extent that the Yaburara/Mardudhunera and Wong-Goo-TT-OO applications overlap the Ngarluma/Yindjibarndi claim area, they were consolidated with the Ngarluma/Yindjibarndi application which was heard by Nicholson J, first, in 1999.The Ngarluma/Yindjibarndi People were ultimately described as the first applicants in the proceeding, the Yaburara/Mardudhunera People became the second applicants and the Wong-Goo-TT-OO People became the third applicants.The State was the first respondent and there were other respondents.On 3 July 2003, Nicholson J handed down his reasons in Daniel .Subsequently, on 2 July 2005, his Honour made a determination under the NTA of non-exclusive native title rights and interests in respect of the claim area (Daniel Determination).The holders of the native title rights and interests so determined were the Ngarluma People and the Yindjibarndi People.His Honour dismissed, to the extent that they overlap with the claim of the Ngarluma/Yindjibarndi People, any competing claims of the Yaburara/Mardudhunera and the Wong-Goo-TT-OO Peoples.There were two appeals pursued from the reasons and orders of Nicholson J.They were heard together.The first appeal was that lodged by Ngarluma/Yindjibarndi.It concerned certain portions of the claim area in which his Honour had found that native title had been wholly extinguished.The Full Court delivered judgment in Moses on 7 June 2007.Then on 27 August 2007, the Full Court made final orders and a substituted determination of native title.That determination is annexed and marked 'D'.In a second appeal lodged by the Wong-Goo-TT-OO People, it was contended that the proceedings at first instance involved a wholly inadequate appraisal of the evidence of Wong-Goo-TT-OO and a misdirection of what was required to establish the elements of native title under s 223(1) NTA.That appeal was dismissed by the Full Court on 7 June 2007 in Dale v Moses [2007] FCAFC 82 ( Dale ).The townsites (of Dampier and Karratha) were not, however, claimed by the Ngarluma/Yindjibarndi and therefore were not the subject of the determination made by Nicholson J.This is also reflected in the determination and orders made by his Honour on 2 May 2005 and was not disturbed on appeal.Until further order, because the Yaburara/Mardudhunera's claim was only dismissed to the extent that it overlapped with the claim of the Ngarluma/Yindjibarndi, the Yaburara/Mardudhunera claim over the townsites remains on foot.It is that claim which is the subject of attack in the State's application for summary dismissal.SPECIFIC CONCLUSIONS IN DANIEL  In relation to the Yaburara/Mardudhunera claim, the State contends that Nicholson J in Daniel made a number of key findings which operate against the Yaburara/Mardudhunera as an issue estoppel.Specifically, it contends that the following are the applicable findings:   (1) The second applicants [the Yaburara /Mardudhunera claimants] claim the lands said to have originally been occupied by the Yaburara people, being the Burrup and surrounding islands, and the country said to have traditionally been occupied by the Mardudhunera people.( Daniel at [99])     (2) I accept the submission for the first respondents that it is not clear on the pleadings whether the overlap area is said to be Yaburara or Mardudhunera or partly Yaburara and partly Mardudhunera or joint Yaburara/Mardudhunera.The evidence from the second applicants on the point was inconsistent.( Daniel at [103])     (3) The second applicants have identified themselves in the title of their application as 'Coastal Mardudhunera and Yaburara people' ... [and] [t]he claimant group is said to be a joint community of Yaburara and Mardudhunera people, composed of three inter-related family groups.( Daniel at [340])     (4) ... I find those of the second applicants who claim to be Yaburara have not established that to be the case.The evidence supports the view that the second applicants having a claim in the claim area claim as Mardudhunera .( Daniel at [352]; Moses at 41]).    (5) There remains the question whether the second applicants as Mardudhunera people are a community or group .There is ample evidence of the Mardudhunera people as a tribe in the coastal zone of the claim areas.It is not apparent, however, whether the second applicants comprise all presently living Mardudhunera people.Nor is it apparent in the evidence whether the second applicants are recognised socially as a community of Mardudhunera people.The relevant common purpose is that of being Mardudhunera.While there is not evidence the second applicants are recognised by others as such apart from their role in these proceedings, I consider they fall within the broader connotation of the word 'group'.( Daniel at [353]; Moses at [29])     (6) ... In the case of the second applicants the issue arises as to whether the Yaburara tribe, of which some of the second applicants claim to be descendents, ceased to exist.The nature of the issue, the submissions of the parties, the expert evidence and the lay evidence relating to that issue is set out in Appendix G .In reliance upon the matters there set out, I find that there has been no discharge of the onus of proof by the second applicants or in the circumstances of all the evidence that the Burrup was inhabited by the Yaburara.If, contrary to that finding, the evidence supports the finding that the Yaburara or a group by any other name inhabited the Burrup, the evidence establishes that that group disappeared as an identifiable group early in the Twentieth Century .( Daniel at [373]; Moses at [43])     (7) Further, there are a number of reasons why I consider that the claim for succession by either the first or second applicants from Iniarba as a Yaburara cannot succeed.Firstly, there is the unsubstantiated character of the evidence of the two second applicants Colin Cosmos and Valerie Holborow on this issue.Secondly, the evidence does not support a finding that Iniarba was Ngarluma.Thirdly, the argument that Yaburara was a sub-set of Ngarluma is not supported by the evidence .( Daniel at [374])     (8) The question remains whether the second applicants being Mardudhunera are members of a group which has had continuity from sovereignty and so has not ceased to exist.In reliance on the evidence set out in relation to the Mardudhunera as a Group in Part X, I find the group has had the requisite continuity .( Daniel at [375])     (9) The evidence does not establish that the Mardudhunera second applicants exercised the remaining two rights found to be presently observable continuously back to sovereignty.If they had connection at the time of sovereignty it has not survived the passage of time.I find no requisite connection is established in their case .( Daniel at [501])     (10) The trial judge dismissed the Yaburara/Mardudhunera application to the extent that it overlapped with the Ngarluma/Yindijibarndi claim.(Order 24 of the Daniel Determination ; Moses at [92]).(emphasis added)   The Yaburara/Mardudhunera are correct in saying that not all of the portions of the Daniel decision on which the State rely, constitute findings.Some are comment but I have emphasised those that are findings.The remaining matters are necessarily stated to put the findings in perspective.Nicholson J found in Daniel (at [373]) that no society has inhabited the Burrup area since the beginning of the early Twentieth Century (see also Moses at [43]).The Yaburara/Mardudhunera acknowledge that they are bound by that finding.The State contends that it must follow that the applicants are estopped from asserting the continuity of any society since sovereignty over the area of the Burrup.Once that is acknowledged, it is fatal to the applicants' claim to Dampier which is geographically part of the Burrup and surrounded on all sides by the area in which Nicholson J found that there was no native title.As to Karratha, Nicholson J held in Daniel (at [370]-[371]) that the society holding native title over the Ngarluma native title area at sovereignty and at present is the Ngarluma society.That area fully surrounds the relatively small area of Karratha townsite.The Yaburara/Mardudhunera contend that the townsites present different issues from the surrounding areas under consideration in Daniel .The State contends that the townsite of Dampier, in particular, presents the same issues as were considered by Nicholson J in Daniel in relation to the Burrup and secondly, that Karratha presents the same issues as were decided in relation to the Ngarluma native title area because: (a) Dampier and Karratha are surrounded on all sides by the Burrup and Ngarluma native title area respectively; (b) the claim does not distinguish between Dampier and Karratha and the surrounding areas; (c) Dampier and Karratha were not considered in Daniel only because the Ngarluma/Yindjibarndi claimants decided not to include those towns in their original claim.It is now asserted (in WAD165/2008) that they do hold native title over each of those towns; (d) the judgment in Daniel indicates that extensive evidence was given of the nature of asserted native title rights in relation to the Burrup and the Ngarluma native title area including by the applicants (see the Summary in Daniel at [1374]-[1383]).In the course of giving that evidence, no distinction was drawn between the areas and the towns; (e) because of the arbitrary distinction between the towns and the surrounding areas, it is reasonable to expect that any evidence capable of supporting the existence of native title within the towns would not have been limited to the towns and would have been led.The fact that such evidence was not led by the applicants even though certain of their evidence was in fact led about areas not included in the proceedings (as evident from Daniel at [308]) and also referred to in the Daniel Summary at [1379]-[1380]) would indicate that the applicants do not distinguish between the towns and the surrounding areas.The State contends that if the issues relating to Karratha are not identical to the issues concerning the surrounding areas, they are so similar as to disclose no reasonable chance of success for the claim in relation to the towns.Further, the State argues, it would be an abuse of process for the applicants to assert a different basis for their claim over Karratha to the one that was asserted in Daniel .It is argued that there is no value whatsoever in the applicants leading evidence of native title over either of the towns.The State also contends that in the interests of certainty, the strike out claim to the extent it includes Dampier, should be allowed in accordance with the State's motion or, alternatively, there should be a declaration that the claim does not include Dampier or, alternatively, an order that the claim is amended such that it excludes Dampier.MOSES  The Full Court summarised the findings of Nicholson J as to the boundaries of the Ngarluma country (in Moses at [243]) where the Full Court said: In Part II of the July 2003 reasons, his Honour described the claim areas and made findings concerning the boundaries of those areas.The area claimed by the Ngarluma people was described as the lowlands between the Chichester Ranges and the sea found between Poverty Creek to the east of Whim Creek on the eastern side of the claim areas, to the vicinity of the Maitland River on the western side of the claim areas, as well as the adjacent portion of the sea.His Honour found that the boundaries as claimed were established on the evidence.The technique used by his Honour in this section, and followed in later sections, was to record the claims and findings in the body of his reasons for judgment and then to refer to the evidence on which the findings were based in appendices to the reasons for judgment.The evidence concerning boundaries is collated in Appendix A.It is a comprehensive review of the primary evidence of Aboriginal witnesses, as well as a review of the evidence of experts in history, linguistics and anthropology.His Honour also pointed out that the major population centres of west Pilbara, namely Dampier, Karratha, Wickham, Point Sampson, Roebourne and Cossack are located in the north-west coastal portion of the claim area, and that the remainder of the region is sparsely settled.  ...   Much evidence was given as to the boundaries of Ngarluma country.His Honour made findings that this evidence established that the Ngarluma country included the Karratha area.Such evidence supported an inference that the Ngarluma people have retained a continuous connection with the Karratha area .(emphasis added) The Full Court also noted (at [313]) in Moses that the Ngarluma area had been treated as a whole for the reason that Nicholson J formed the view on the evidence that it was all part of Ngarluma lands.Subject only to the important qualification that the specific townsite of Karratha was not part of the claim, the conclusion expressed (at [305]) in Moses , appears to fully and finally conclude any possibility of the Yaburara/Mardudhunera establishing a claim over the Karratha townsite.The State and Ngarluma contend that these findings were all essential to the ratio of the conclusions that the Ngarluma People had native title throughout the area.Those conclusions, it is contended, are all that is required for issue estoppel for the reason that the Yaburara/Mardudhunera will not be permitted to allege facts that contradict the relevant foundational facts established in the Daniel decision.There is no doubt, it is contended, that it is open to look not only at the final judgment and order but also the reasons as well.This submission is correct ( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (No 3) [2001] FCA 1861 ; (2001) 119 FCR 1 at [1153] - [1154] per Goldberg J).The findings in Daniel were not only positive for the Ngarluma People but also, necessarily, negative to the claim of the Yaburara/Mardudhunera.To the extent that the findings were based on the failure to be satisfied by the evidence of the Yaburara/Mardudhunera, the Yaburara/Mardudhunera are estopped by the finding that they do not hold native title in the area and by the finding that any use and enjoyment of resources and protection of important places that they engaged in did not have the required continuity back to sovereignty and thus not traditional.Those negative findings can still constitute an estoppel: see the analysis in Egri .FINDINGS AGAINST THE YABURARA/MARDUDHUNERA IN DANIEL  The Yaburara/Mardudhunera claim brought in Daniel was brought on the basis that the areas claimed were the areas where the Yaburara and the Mardudhunera People held native title.They claimed that the claim areas were traditionally occupied by them ( Daniel at [99]).Nicholson J rejected and dismissed the claims insofar as they overlapped the Ngarluma/Yindjibarndi claim and found that the areas were areas over which only the Ngarluma or Yindjibarndi People held native title.Accordingly, his Honour's finding was, in effect, that the areas surrounding the townsites were not Yaburara or Mardudhunera country and the Yaburara/Mardudhunera People did not hold any native title rights within it.Evidence given by the Yaburara/Mardudhunera witnesses in Daniel as to boundaries of the Yaburara/Mardudhunera country or Yaburara country or Mardudhunera country included parts of the Ngarluma determination.Such evidence did not draw a distinction between areas surrounding the townsites and the townsites themselves which had been excluded from the hearing.This is apparent from the following passages in Daniel (at [1199]-[1200], [1374]-[1383], [1666]-[1667] (emphasis added): Robert Boona (Y) had been told by his father that the boundary of their land went from the mouth of the Nickol River, back into the Leopold Ranges, then went further down south to the Fortescue.The boundary followed Princup Hill to the Leopold ranges (T 2966).His father told him never to look at the Burrup (T 2970).Valerie Holborow had no knowledge of the boundaries of her land (T2974) and relied upon the boundaries as presented in evidence by Robert Boona (Y) , Colin Cosmos (Y) and Lawrence Kerr (N) (T 3063).Colin Cosmos (Y) had been told nothing of the boundaries of Mardudhunera land but Algie Patterson (M) had told him that they were from the mouth of the Fortescue up to Leopold Hill and towards the Fortescue River (T 2974).The following day he corrected this, saying that the boundaries were from the mouth of the Nickol River, to Mount Leopold and towards the Fortescue River and that he had been told this by his grandfather (T 2999).Lawrence Kerr (N) said that Algie Patterson (M) had told him that Mardudhunera country stretched from Fortescue, to Peters Creek and back to Nickol (T 3005).In cross examination he said that the territory between Miaree Pool on the Maitland River and Karratha town, in other words the area of Karratha station, was Mardudhunera country.He knew nothing of Yaburara country apart from the name (T 3036).Robert Boona (Y) agreed that the boundaries claimed as Mardudhunera in the overlap claim area were those of Karratha station.He denied that his father may have been referring to the station as the area for which they had responsibility when they were doing their mill run (T 3074).Colin Cosmos (Y) said that the Yaburara people were different from the Mardudhunera, and had distinct territories.He only knew the boundary from what he had recently read (T 3084).Robert Boona (Y) , whom Mr Robinson identified as a Mardudhunera man, told Mr Robinson that the Maitland River was the boundary (T 5453).Mr Robinson accepted the view that Yindjibarndi people regarded the Mardudhunera as the people who lived downstream from them on the lower Fortescue River (T 5519).Mr O'Connor agreed under cross-examination that he had earlier conducted ethnographic survey work for the second applicants and had formed a view that they were entitled to lodge a native title claim (T 6111).In a site survey he conducted in 1997, he described the Yaburara as 'coastal people whose territories were centred upon the Burrup Peninsula, the present towns of Dampier and Karratha and the surrounding coastal plain'.He qualified that to mean 'coastal flats' and noted that Karratha town is built partly on the coastal flats.He agreed that boundaries in Aboriginal Australia are not a matter of general agreement .(T 6114)   (a) POSSESS, OCCUPY, USE AND ENJOY      (a) 'The right to possess the land and waters claimed.'  (b) 'The right to occupy the land and waters claimed.'  (c) 'The right to use and enjoy that land and waters claimed.'    Dorrie Wally testified that Valerie Holborow's and Colin Cosmos' father had been Mardudhunera and had been initiated (T 3003).Colin Cosmos considered his father Yaburara but had not been told anything about the law from him (T 2952).To his knowledge his father had no connection to the Burrup (T 3095).Colin Cosmos grew up on Karratha station.It was like a little Aboriginal village then.He could remember some people who lived there including Kenny Jerrold (T 3009).He was told of his ancestors by Algie Paterson , but not which tribe they belonged to (T3020).He lived separately from the other Aboriginal people on Karratha station (T 3065).He was not taught anything about the Burrup (T 2991).He felt his family's claim to the land came from their descent from Inarba, his father's step-father, who was a Yaburara man (T 2952; 3021).He only concluded he was Yaburara from reading material published recently, not from his own knowledge of Aboriginal groups and culture which was poor (T 3020).Even if Inarba were shown to be Ngarluma he would still consider himself most entitled to the Burrup through descent (T 3022).He heard from an old man on Karratha station that his land stretched from the mouth of the Nickol River to Leopold Hill and towards the Fortescue River (T 2975; 2999).His maternal grandmother's brother was Fred Hicks, and he acknowledged being related to Wilfred and Cane Hicks (T 3012).Lawrence Kerr testified that he had been initiated the Ngarluma way because his father was Ngarluma.His mother and step-father were Mardudhunera and he could have been initiated the Mardudhunera way.He knew of only one other surviving Mardudhunera man, Algie Paterson (T 3004-3005).Algie Paterson had told him of certain Mardudhunera places, from Fortescue River to Peters Creek and across to the Nickol River.He did not mention the Burrup (T 3006).Robert Boona's mother was related to the Hicks family but he did not know details (T 3044).His mother was Yindjibarndi and his father was Mardudhunera which he equated with Yaburara.His father had pointed out the boundaries of his country which roughly coincided with the boundaries of Karratha station (T 3073).He knew no Aboriginal place names in that area (T 3074).He said their traditional land extended to the small offshore islands (T 2969).He had never been told by any of the old people of any fishing out among those islands (T 3033).Dorene Wescombe regarded herself as Mardudhunera after her father.She was related through her father with the Cosmos and Boona family (T 2956).She grew up on Mardi (not in the overlap area between the first and second applicants claims) and Karratha stations (T 2984).Margaret Boona grew up on Mardi and later Karratha stations (T 2988-2989).Valerie Holborow testified that her grandmother was Yaburara, from the Burrup, as was her father.She had no knowledge of the boundaries of her country (T 2974).

Dorene Wescombe was shown how to hunt and cook goanna and gather witchetty grubs and sweet potato by her grandparents and parents on Mardi station (T 2979; 2982-2983).She lived in Derby when her children were young and didn't take them fishing or hunting there (T 2985).Mardi station and Derby are outside the overlap area between the first and second applicants' claims.Dorene Wescombe still hunts kangaroo inland from Karratha (T 2984).She fished in the Fortescue River.She was taught by her grandmother (T 2979).She fished in the sea at Karratha, gathered shellfish and watched her father catch turtles (T 2984).She teaches her grandchildren to gather bush tucker (T 2986).Margaret Boona was taught hunting and gathering bush tucker by her parents.She fished in the Fortescue River and around Roebourne (T 2988-2989).Roebourne is outside the overlap area between the first and second applicants' claims.Colin Cosmos takes his son hunting, and teaches him what he knows about skinning kangaroo and traditional methods of cooking of goanna (T 2991).He fished with his father at Wajabi waterhole on the upper Fortescue River near Karratha station and in the ocean at the mouth of the Yanari River (T 2976).He takes his family fishing on day trips to Nguria Point (' 40 Mile'), Withnell Bay and Hearson Cove on the Burrup, The Landing, the Yanari River (T 2990; 3085).He fishes from the shore (T 3100).  (e) MAINTAIN AND PROTECT PLACES OF IMPORTANCE      (k) 'The right to maintain and protect places of importance on the land and in the waters claimed.'    Colin Cosmos has been on one heritage survey on the Burrup.His brothers and sisters do not attend because they know nothing of the law for that area.Robert Boona does any 'heritage work' (T 3057).Robert Boona testified that his father warned them as children not to look at the Burrup or their spirit would be taken away (T 3029).Colin Cosmos was told by his father the Maitland could be a dangerous place because of a snake that lived in a permanent waterhole there (T 2992), and a waterhole at Leopold Hills upon which one should never allow one's shadow to cast (T 2975).  (f) PROTECT AND PREVENT MISUSE OF CULTURAL KNOWLEDGE      (l) 'The right to maintain, protect and prevent misuse of cultural knowledge associated with the land and waters claimed.'    Valerie Holborow and Colin Cosmos testified that their father had scarification on his body.He had never discussed it with them (T 2972; 2978).Colin Cosmos did not know if they were 'sorry scars' (T 3051).Valerie Holborow testified she did not know their meaning because she was a woman (T 3090).Her father took his law and culture seriously and would not divulge it to his daughter.Nor did he speak of it to his son Colin (T 2952).He would engage in ritual such as spraying water at water holes (T 2973).Lawrence Kerr had been initiated.He testified that scarification indicated a person had been initiated and was a senior lawman.The practice was no longer continued.He did not know why (T 3006-3007).Robert Boona's father had not been initiated (T 3043).Robert Boona testified that he was not an initiated tribal person, because all traditional Mardudhunera law, songs, dance had been extinguished (T 2953).He had been prevented from undergoing initiation at Woodbrook for that reason (T 3046).His and Colin Cosmos' fathers conversed in Mardudhunera.Very few could (T 2955).Dorene Wescombe testified her father and the older men on Mardi and Karratha stations would talk in a language she assumed was Mardudhunera.They did not teach any of it to her.Her father forbade her going anywhere near men's meetings by the river (T 2980).She only speaks her mother's language, Yindjibarndi, which she teaches to her grandchildren (T 2985).Colin Cosmos acknowledged that when he was growing up there were men on his country who knew and practiced the law of that country, including Mibbin Lowe and Tim Kerr (T 3025).He did not know the law himself (T 3026), but expressed a desire to learn it, if necessary from Ngarluma men who knew it (T 3028).His father had never taught him anything about it (T 2975).Dorene Wescombe (T 2981), Margaret Boona (T 2988), Colin Cosmos (T 2991) all recounted that their family was only permitted to kill and eat the yellow goanna.The black goanna would harm them.Margaret Boona was taught to placate the yellow goanna's spirit by cutting off its tail.Mardudhunera's rights not exercised continuously back to sovereignty Further and more fundamentally to the current assertion of issue estoppel, his Honour (crucially) found that the rights claimed were not exercised continuously back to the time of sovereignty.That finding was expressed in Daniel (at [501]) where the following appears: The evidence does not establish that the Mardudhunera second applicants exercised the remaining two rights found to be presently observable continuously back to sovereignty.If they had connection at the time of sovereignty it has not survived the passage of time.I find no requisite connection is established in their case.(emphasis added) There is a summary of some of the evidence leading to the conclusion set out in Daniel (at [1656]-[1658]) where the following appears: Radcliffe-Brown writing in 1913 relevantly described the Mardudhunera people's country as bordering that of the Ngarluma people at the Maitland River.He said they probably did not number a hundred, and they mostly lived on sheep stations.The tribe was divided into a number of local groups each with its own defined country.He identified important camping places in each of these groups' areas.He did not indicate the existence of such a group within the relevant overlap claim area.He was able to establish genealogical links between the Mardudhunera he met and those living before the European occupation of their country.   ... ... ...      (e) Maintain and protect places of importance      'The right to maintain and protect places of importance on the land...claimed'    A report in 1893 remarked the Aboriginal people on Mardi station were much stricter in their observance of tribal law than those nearer Roebourne, and that they held regular corroborees.Radcliffe-Brown, writing in 1913 observed that some of the customs of the Mardudhunera resembled those of the 'Fortescue tribes' (which includes the Yindjibarndi).The Mardudhunera had a system of totems resembling those of the Kariyarra (which in turn he found resembled the Ngarluma system), and performed ceremonies, called talu for the purpose of increasing these totems.Those rights, such as they were, were not found to be rights and interests satisfying the Yorta Yorta tests of continuity ( Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria [2002] HCA 58 ; (2002) 214 CLR 422).The State, supported by the Ngarluma People, now submit that no valid distinction could be made between the townsites and the rest of the Ngarluma determined area as there is, not only, no distinction made in the course of the evidence given but, more importantly, that the Yaburara/Mardudhunera People were found not to have exercised rights continuously back to the time of sovereignty.In the proposed determination reflecting the findings of Nicholson J on this topic, it was originally intended to record that the Yaburara/Mardudhunera People do not hold native title in the determination area (see Daniel at [1163] - Daniel Determination at [5]).Subsequently that finding was not included.It was unnecessary in the final determination because the determination could only mean that the Ngarluma People were the only people found to be native title holders in the area.SAME PARTIES OR PRIVIES  The Yaburara/Mardudhunera, the State and the Ngarluma People were all parties to the previous proceedings.The Ngarluma People as part of a Ngarluma/Yindjibarndi claim received their own determination.Even if not parties, they were clearly 'privies' as that expression has been used.They had the key interest in that decision and a benefit from it.'Privies' refer to people with such a community of interest (see Carl Zeiss Stiftung [1967] 1 AC 853).The existence of (or addition of) any different respondents makes no difference to the issue estoppel.In Quall (at [78]) the Court held that the existence of a different respondent in the form of a Shire Council made no difference to the question of issue estoppel nor did the fact that there are other parties to the earlier proceedings who are not parties to the current action.It was the same party seeking to agitate the same issues.See also Taylor v Ansett Transport Industries Ltd (1987) 18 FCR 342 per Fisher J at 356-358, with whom Ryan J agreed at 365.CONCLUSION ON ISSUE ESTOPPEL  The conclusion at [501] in Daniel to the effect that the evidence did not establish that the Mardudhunera second applicants exercised the remaining two rights found to be presently observed or continuously back to sovereignty and that if they had connection at the time of sovereignty, it did not survive the passage of time, is sufficient to establish an issue estoppel as against the Yaburara/Mardudhunera.That conclusion, taken with the conclusion of the Full Court in Moses ([at 305]) and the analysis by his Honour collected in the summary appearing in [77] above make it clear that his Honour reached a finding which it is no longer open for the Yaburara/Mardudhunera to challenge.It would be wholly artificial, in my view, to suggest that those findings in a circumstance where no distinction was made in any of the evidence led between the townsite of Karratha and the surrounding area, that a different conclusion might be reached as to the status of the Yaburara/Mardudhunera within the townsite of Karratha as distinct from the entirety of the surrounding claim area.Such a conclusion would be inconceivable.I conclude, therefore, that the Yaburara/Mardudhunera are estopped from advancing a claim for native title in respect of the townsite of Karratha.Are there policy considerations which militate against issue estoppel?Although elements of flexibility and discretion can be found in the NTA, the concept of issue estoppel is more than a rule of evidence.It is more correctly viewed as a substantive rule of law: Canada and Dominion Sugar Company Limited v Canadian National (West Indies) Steamships Limited [1947] AC 46 , 56 per Lord Wright for the Privy Council.An issue estoppel is not lightly found but if found, there does not appear to be any discretionary basis to ignore it.It is strongly contended by the State and the Ngarluma People that all factors point in any event in favour of the estoppel being applied.It is contended that the Yaburara/Mardudhunera simply wish to relitigate their whole claim to native title in the remainder of the claim area on the same grounds on which they had previously failed.As in Quall , even if the two issues were not identical for the purposes of an issue estoppel, they were sufficiently similar for the purposes of an abuse of process.The same logic applies in the present circumstances: see Quall at 116.The underlying philosophy is compelling.In Quall (at [119]) the view expressed by Reeves J was that it was in the interests of justice to ensure that Court resources are devoted to the resolution of real and genuine native title determination applications which have not been provided with a determination on their merits.Further, it would not be in the interests of justice to create a situation of conflicting determinations.The Yaburara/Mardudhunera stress that the submissions of the State of Western Australia (the State) assume that any future trial court will have no 'discretion' about the application of issue estoppel.However, this assumes there is a discretion when it comes to issue estoppel.The Yaburara/Mardudhunera also fortify their submission with the flexibility with which it is said that s 86 NTA is cast.Section 86 relevantly provides as follows:   86 Evidence and findings in other proceedings     (1) Subject to subsection 82(1), the Federal Court may :      (a) receive into evidence the transcript of evidence in any other proceedings before:        (i) the Court; or (ii) another court; or (iii) the NNTT; or (iv) a recognised State/Territory body; or (v) any other person or body; and draw any conclusions of fact from that transcript that it thinks proper; and        (b) receive into evidence the transcript of evidence in any proceedings before the assessor and draw any conclusions of fact from that transcript that it thinks proper; and (c) adopt any recommendation, finding, decision or judgment of any court, person or body of a kind mentioned in any of subparagraphs (a)(i) to (v).     (2) Subject to subsection 82(1), the Federal Court:      (a) must consider whether to receive into evidence the transcript of evidence from a native title application inquiry; and (b) may draw any conclusions of fact from that transcript that it thinks proper; and (c) may adopt any recommendation, finding, decision or determination of the NNTT in relation to the inquiry.(emphasis added)    The Yaburara/Mardudhunera contend that the word 'may' in the opening passage of s 86(1) makes it clear that any future trial court will have a discretion as to whether or not to adopt or not adopt a recommendation, finding, decision or judgment falling within s 86(1)(c).The respondents contend that the findings and judgment on which the State seeks to rely are all caught by s 86(1)(c) such that there is a discretion in the future trial court to adopt or not adopt the findings on which the State seeks to rely.However if the State is correct as to the issue estoppel argument, the Yaburara/Mardudhunera claim over the townsites should be dismissed.Section 86 NTA will not be engaged.Nor is there any other discretion.It is doubtful whether there is room for any discretionary factor.The threshold for establishing an issue estoppel is high.The requirements are exact and have been clearly prescribed.None of those requirements appears to invoke any overriding discretionary aspect.Nevertheless, the underlying doctrine as it has been explained in the cases behind the doctrine of issue estoppel can be seen to have relevance to the present case.The Yaburara/Mardudhunera assertion that the Yaburara/Mardudhunera People form a society that has existed continuously since sovereignty and the assertion that they have maintained their traditional lifestyle and connection with the land has been exhaustively and extensively ventilated in previous hearings.The duration of the Daniel hearing and appeal and the extensive analysis in the respective judgments would all have been wasted if the Yaburara/Mardudhunera were permitted to progress the present claim in respect of Karratha townsite.There is a real interest in achieving finality of litigation.It would also be an undesirable conflict if a Judge hearing future proceedings reached a different conclusion than that reached by Nicholson J on the same point in relation to the issue.By its adoption of Wong-Goo-TT-OO's arguments, Yaburara/Mardudhunera complains that the State is failing in its model litigant obligation by refusing to negotiate with the Yaburara/Mardudhunera.This submission misconceives any statutory obligation under the NTA.There is certainly an obligation to negotiate in good faith for a period of six months in relation to future acts but there is no reason to believe that in circumstances where there is a proper foundation for a view that a claim has no basis, the State should continue to negotiate for resolution of it.That would clearly produce an impractical outcome ( North Ganalanja Aboriginal Corporation v Queensland [1996] HCA 2 ; (1996) 185 CLR 595 at 615).Is the fact that Yaburara/Mardudhunera's claim has been registered relevant to issue estoppel?Also by adoption of Wong-Goo-TT-OO's arguments, Yaburara/Mardudhunera contend that the fact that the claim has been registered adds support to the Yaburara/Mardudhunera position giving rise to a presumption that the claimed rights and interests exist.This presumption, it is contended, adds to the burden on behalf of the State in establishing that no reasonable cause of action is disclosed.In my view, registration does not fortify the presumption that the asserted native title rights exist, at least for the purposes of this motion.Registration is an administrative act.It involves no real assessment of the actual merits of the claim.Registration itself may be conducted on the basis of an assumption that the facts asserted in the relevant native title application are true but it does not follow that in the context of an issue estoppel challenge the Court must operate on the same presumption.If it did, there would never be a successful challenge on the basis of issue estoppel.Further, there was such registration prior to the decisions in Daniel and Dale which judgement's plainly rebutted any presumption which may have previously existed.There is no longer any presumption.ALTERNATIVE ARGUMENT  The State has advanced the following alternative argument.Technically, none of the findings identified relate specifically to the townsite of Karratha because it and other towns were excluded from the original Ngarluma/Yindjibarndi claim.However, it is submitted that these findings apply equally to Karratha in substance because Karratha is surrounded by the area to which the orders apply.It is not plausible, it is said, that different orders could be made in relation to Karratha.The submission is supported by the fact that the holders of native title in the area surrounding Karratha, the Ngarluma People, assert native title over Karratha as well.Given two competing claims over the town (as opposed to a single claim by two claim groups asserting overlapping rights, as was the case with Ngarluma and Yindjibarndi Peoples in relation to part of the Ngarluma/Yindjibarndi claim), it is implausible that any claim other than the Ngarluma claim to the townsite of Karratha could succeed.Having reached a conclusion on the basis of issue estoppel, it is unnecessary to rule on this argument.As an aside, however, were that the only argument, I would be less inclined to allow it as a basis for dismissal of the claim, notwithstanding that it has a logical appeal.I would not be prepared to conclude that the present Yaburara/Mardudhunera claim should be dismissed as disclosing no reasonable cause of action on the basis that it is 'seriously implausible' that a claim could succeed in respect of Karratha despite having failed all around the townsite.It may be highly unlikely that such a claim could succeed because there is little doubt that the evidence in Daniel was relevant to the entirety of the area.The real basis for dismissal is the conclusion at [501] in Daniel and at [352], [353], [373], [374] and 375].Barwick CJ adopted a number of expressions from earlier decisions encapsulating the extent to which the Court would have to be satisfied that a case should be dismissed for showing no reasonable cause of action.I do not consider that any of those expressions descends into the arena of implausibility whether it be at the high end of the implausibility scale or the low end.The degree of certainty that a court must have as to the absence of a reasonable cause of action is at a level above implausibility: see Australian Building Industries Pty Ltd v Stramit Corporation Limited 2amp; Anor [1997] FCA 1318 , Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 4) (2005) 214 ALR 686 at [14] and Millet J in Lonrho Plc v Fayed (No 2) [1992] 1 WLR 1 (Ch 9) at 5.Of course the new lower threshold introduced by legislation in s 31A FCA sets a different test.The very need for that legislative amendment fortifies the view that under the former Rules applicable to this motion, serious implausibility or serious improbability fall a little short of the mark.IMPLAUSIBILITY COMPARED WITH INCONCEIVABILITY  Although the State contends that summary judgment may be given on the basis of a claim being implausible, for my part, this lowers the bar under the old General Steel test a little too far.Implausibility would be more in line with the new test under s 31A FCA.However, in a circumstance in which the prospect of a claim succeeding is inconceivable (that is, beyond any rational as distinct from theoretical possibility), in my view, the position is different.In my view, it is inconceivable that in the circumstances described, particularly where no distinction is drawn between the small area now occupied by a modern mining town which did not exist until a century or more after sovereignty, that connection evidence would be any different from evidence as to the entire surrounding areas.As has been pointed out, evidence was not given in the context of conventional European boundaries by reference to longitude, latitude etcetera but rather by reference to primary physical geographical features such as mountain ranges, rivers, the ocean and such like.DECLARATION IN RELATION TO DAMPIER  I fully accept that counsel, properly instructed, has made very clear in open Court in a manner which is intended to be a binding concession, that the townsite of Dampier is not pursued in this claim.Notwithstanding this, having regard to the very substantial resources which have been devoted to litigation in this area in relation to native title, it seems to me desirable to put beyond doubt the question of whether or not the Yaburara/Mardudhunera People have any entitlement to pursue a claim in respect of the Dampier townsite.In that regard, I propose to order that the claim for native title in respect of the townsite of Dampier as defined in Annexure 'B' to these reasons be dismissed.CONCLUSION  I do not underestimate the exceptional caution required to exercise the power to dismiss on a summary basis.Nor do I underestimate the demanding standards required of a dismissal on the basis of issue estoppel.However, that said, I have no doubt that the Yaburara/Mardudhunera are estopped in the manner asserted by the State.It follows that the State's motion is to be allowed.Pursuant to s 85A NTA, there will be no order as to costs.I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty (120) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice McKerracher.Associate:
