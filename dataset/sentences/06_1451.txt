  1 So far as the categories of documents are concerned in paragraph 1 of the notice of motion which I have been considering, a good deal of my thinking will have been revealed in the course of the debate which has been recorded in the transcript, but I will just run through those documents and indicate a short basis for my rulings.2 As regards the documents referred to in paragraph 1(a), in my view, the recommendation which went to the decision-maker expressly referred to and identified the particular reports concerned.Although I do not equate the recommender with the decision-maker in this case, it seems to me that the specific reference to that material which was before that party brings it within the penumbra which is reasonably producible on discovery.3 In my opinion, paragraphs 16 and 23 of the recommendation to which reference is made in paragraph (b) of the motion, do not identify documents which were before the decision-maker in the sense to which I have just referred.4 Paragraph (d) is a coverall and I do not think anything is gained from that category.5 Although in a very broad sense, the documents described in paragraph (e), dealing with 'the criteria', could be described as being before the decision-maker, it seems to me that that is stretching that concept too far in the present case.It is true that the recommender obviously gave thought to these criteria in the course of his mental processes, but what use is made of them, if any, in forming his view is quite unclear.I do not think this is sufficient to link it with any claim for relief. I certify that the preceding five (5) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.Associate:
