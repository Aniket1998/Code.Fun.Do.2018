In gener sens purpos tia act strike balanc one hand allow law enforc author access import inform protect privaci member public 
It provid gener prohibit intercept telecommun provid narrow except 
the respond submit kizon v palmer fcr appli case relevantli distinguish

thi reason equal forc whether public australia elsewher 
the next point possibl distinct natur public 
In kizon v palmer author gather warrant inform chosen publish open court

In view relev distinct 
assum dea offic evid correct respond publish inform dea 
whether dea breach tia act issu court respond concern way dea use inform matter 
what matter present purpos inform publish public come attent Mr samsonidi 
It demand applic purpos approach refer kizon v palmer 
the final point distinct relat differ evid two case 
In present case pauciti evid circumst alleg convers adduc court athen 
Mr livani dea agent gave evid examin magistr record report translat court 
Mr livani depos inform concern Mr samsonidi came agenc australian author 
the dea conduct investig determin Mr samsonidi two other said head drug network 
the dea contact australian author releas polic record three action perform 
further report said On legal accord australia law tap samsonidi phone heard eleven night australian time name three pm greek time skoura contact samsonidi phone told two spoke foreign languag obvious greek 
It clear precis word passag intend refer 
It evid report convers Mr samsonidi Mr skoura tap I understand mean intercept dea awar content convers 
It clear transcript made convers convers intercept 
the respond neither confirm deni possess intercept inform 
all must contrast posit kizon v palmer evid perfectli clear warrant inform refer open affidavit file australian court proceed 
becaus natur relief sought I come due cours necessari resolv evidenti issu disclos record 
In particular I need decid whether respond fact intercept telephon convers involv Mr samsonidi 
the uncontest evid Mr samsonidi solicitor refer made greek court said intercept commun involv Mr samsonidi 
how publicli evid given clear I think matter 
the purpos approach mandat kizon v palmer appli public world larg 
that would lead unjustifi result 
the mischief approach recognis merkel J carmodi v mackellar person know commun intercept could access evid commun need challeng legal 
similarli mischief approach kizon v palmer accus person access inform use crimin proceed order may rebut inform 
the purpos approach mean least intent legislatur person obtain inform publish use inform either challeng legal obtain defend alleg made result inform 
In latter case interpret would run contrari principl justic fair requir prosecutor disclos materi defend see R v reardon nswcca per hodgson JA R v sasc per sulan J 
In circumst may case public world larg tia act may still prohibit deal involv public intercept inform alreadi awar 
In case Mr samsonidi publish purport fact intercept inform concern obtain 
An interpret deni access obtain inform would absurd author kizon v palmer interpret must reject 
altern argument Mr samsonidi rais altern argument base tia act

much argument direct mean context 
sinc Mr samsonidi succeed argument necessari consid argument

the respond submit I find Mr samsonidi matter adjourn allow argument question whether ground product inform might resist respond question applic foi act 
It clear judgment end matter sinc parti agre hear foi act point would rais later stage
