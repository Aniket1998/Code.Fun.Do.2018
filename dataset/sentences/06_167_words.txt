He sought numer occas sinc still seek establish matter fact proposit return india subject persecut 
that reason file written submiss enlarg time leav appeal substanti bundl materi I refer I read 
He claim would abl call wit would abl bolster case treatment sikh activ member khalistan liber forc would amount persecut still return today 
He emphasis danger believ 
the difficulti appel attempt make case difficulti I endeavour explain cours hear fact matter tribun tribun 
It open court stage proceed appel taken would like take simpli set asid decis tribun basi court disagre factual conclus tribun 
As I attempt explain appel requir amount jurisdict error someth fundament tribun approach case procedur indic tribun fail perform statutori function review decis deleg minist 
the first issu I must address question whether feder magistr judgment interlocutori final 
thi entir clear either honour order june honour reason 
counsel minist inclin submit judgment interlocutori basi reject applic leav file substant applic complianc former order feder magistr court 
I find imposs read feder magistr reason judgment indic honour treat matter applic leav 
hi honour point appel sought leav court indic would necessari appel appli leav 
It plain none done appel plain feder magistr regard absenc applic leav ground dismiss substant applic regard 
although order made entir clear least said order dismiss applic term refus grant leav bring applic 
I regard bound deal feder magistr judgment basi discretionari judgment refus grant leav bring proceed 
I regard bound deal basi judgment dismiss substant applic file appel yet anoth attempt set asid decis tribun 
thi say howev feder magistr judgment final judgment give appel entitl appeal right 
becaus judgment base absenc leav file applic seem clear enough interlocutori judgment 
although reason judgment feder magistr mention briefli merit applic honour appear dealt applic merit 
inde honour appear deal matter basi mention 
I therefor deal proceed basi judgment appel purport appeal interlocutori judgment consequ leav appeal requir feder court australia act cth 
the first issu relat applic leav appeal time 
although applic made outsid time limit fix O r b feder court rule outsid time fix order august minist content matter dealt basi time issu deal substanc applic leav appeal 
It appropri therefor I make order extend time within appel may appli leav appeal permit make applic 
the next question whether leav appeal grant 
counsel minist refer principl applic leav appeal interlocutori judgment normal dealt 
the first question whether judgment attend suffici doubt warrant hear appeal 
the second question relat whether would substanti injustic done judgment permit stand 
It must said face view I taken feder magistr reason judgment plainli correct 
If basi dismiss applic applic leav file therefor leav grant file feder magistr choic dismiss applic 
It incompet brought without leav 
It necessari howev go littl deal overal justic case I propos 
for reason I endeavour ascertain appel interpret exactli ground would reli seek set asid decis tribun abl 
I conclud I said appel concern regard tribun decis factual correct 
He would like give evid call addit wit suppli materi tribun hope tribun would decid case favour grant protect visa 
for reason I alreadi given cours would open appel 
It seem appel could made case ground could sought set asid tribun decis ground avail provis Pt migrat act stood time applic court dealt north J might still abl make applic set asid decis tribun time made first applic feder magistr court even time made second 
In view first feder magistr judgment honour wrong regard entir matter one estoppel appel bring applic ground respect tribun decis 
for reason I set applic v minist immigr multicultur indigen affair fca seem would open appel rais ground could rais provis Pt migrat act stood time first applic court whatev ground rais high court subject judgment merit estoppel therefor rais respect 
It true might issu anshun estoppel would matter argument 
It perhap regrett feder magistr first judgment reason I consid wrong impos upon appel oblig seek leav feder magistr court institut proceed seek set asid decis tribun 
the unfortun thing first judgment feder magistr I overturn proceed 
I sought ascertain appel cours argument whether substanc alleg tribun fail provid copi document reli fail give opportun comment 
the affidavit law clerk friend help identifi document 
nor appel abl identifi document use tribun affect decis advers appel given opportun comment 
I point even document sourc inform use tribun ascertain posit punjab india gener time decis would suffici purpos principl natur justic procedur fair tribun given appel opportun comment substanc inform contain document 
It would necessari examin transcript tribun hear see whether fact done 
all said appel abl rais case denial natur justic procedur fair ground could appli court Pt migrat act contain provis specif bar court examin tribun decis basi natur justic 
It ground final judgment court therefor reason set passag applic I refer ground would avail appel 
It said appel would succeed much would need done 
So far argument today concern appel indic would abl make case respect document 
As I said abl identifi document affect decis advers given opportun comment 
the view I take therefor matter substanc appel ground avail could seek set asid tribun decis 
thi power reason refus leav appeal 
As appel complaint feder magistr judgment much said 
He complain hear feder magistr court origin set june brought forward june 
He indic disadvantag 
In answer question morn indic complain feder magistr chang date alleg disadvantag present case hear feder magistr appar conduct telephon 
the appel also say abl explain case fairli properli feder magistr court 
He elucid argument explain want explain fact feder magistr court want call wit would say appel life danger return india 
for reason I alreadi given I endeavour explain appel would materi evid relev issu feder magistr court 
that court could taken view tribun simpli got fact wrong basi set asid tribun decis 
the appel complain treat unfairli feder magistr court complain bia 
On question clarifi argument base fact feder magistr court would hear addit wit 
for reason feder magistr oblig hear addit wit 
the refus hear involv treat appel unfairli involv bia part feder magistr 
for reason necessari dismiss appel applic leav appeal 
certainli feder magistr judgment correct face 
certainli would substanti injustic done judgment allow stand 
It follow I also dismiss purport appeal institut notic appeal file june court 
I also propos order appel pay respond cost proceed 
the appel submit abl work money 
ordinarili fact unsuccess litig impecuni regard suffici reason refrain make normal order cost follow event 
It cours matter minist whether order cost worth attempt enforc
