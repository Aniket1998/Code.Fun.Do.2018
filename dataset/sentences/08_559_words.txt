A diol molecul contain two hydroxyl OH group

In proceed lone pair refer sticki handl molecul 
A molecul lone pair sticki handl call nucleophil 
the lone pair attract nuclei particular proton atom molecul

In citalopram atom oxygen two lone pair nitrogen one lone pair function sticki handl 
nucleophil often form bond electrophil

for purpos relev consid electrophil contain carbon posit charg atom due bond electroneg atom group atom 
there two main mechan nucleophil substitut occur 
these distinguish descriptor S N unimolecular nucleophil substitut S N bimolecular nucleophil substitut 
In substanc distinct depend whether substitut occur one step two step 
confusingli S N reaction involv two step call import step involv one molecul electrophil 
the S N reaction involv one step call import step involv nucleophil electrophil simultan 
the first step S N reaction involv loss leav group electrophil give posit charg intermedi molecul 
loss electron pair central carbon atom mean three electron pair around 
the favour structur molecul contain carbon atom three adjoin atom trigon planar flat 
In second step S N reaction nucleophil attack intermedi flat molecul 
be flat equal probabl nucleophil attach one side intermedi 
therefor singl enantiom electrophil use S N process alway result racem 
professor davi said first year undergradu would put asid S N reaction reason 
In case singl step S N reaction occur simultan 
the nucleophil attack carbon atom time leav group leav 
importantli nucleophil must attack central carbon atom close leav group 
there flat intermedi 
therefor electrophil maintain origin stereochemistri 
If electrophil singl enantiom S N process result singl enantiom

As describ gener chemic background favour molecular shape involv maximum separ electron pair 
In case chain carbon atom favour shape involv hydrogen atom adjac carbon atom configur known stagger conform 
If electron pair near eclips conform highli disfavour due repuls

In order obtain ring closur like one connect atom eclips rest molecul disfavour 
further geometr constraint doubl bond nucleophil S N reaction approach angl attack best 
In case citalopram ring unsatur contain doubl bond
