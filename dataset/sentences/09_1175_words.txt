I also direct septemb ona commonwealth make submiss support applic access grant report 
In accord order I made septemb ona commonwealth produc court report also made submiss write 
some report copi origin 
A document also produc respons order I made septemb 
the ona commonwealth continu submit access grant document produc court 
As fallback posit parti submit access grant mask report 
they provid copi report addit portion mask order give effect submiss 
the addit mask leav littl text report open inspect 
they also submit access restrict small number person person requir give appropri undertak court 
At awb No fca I explain reason make order I septemb 
At awb No fca I reserv consider question whether ona claim document produc respons order I made septemb nonetheless protect disclosur public interest immun ground 
I inspect document produc 
I also consid propos advanc ona commonwealth mask submit requir access grant 
As I consid done second stage process I requir undertak balanc exercis I refer awb No fca 
that exercis involv weigh requir due administr justic regard circumst present case public interest protect document disclosur 
that public interest present circumst involv protect nation interest matter nation secur 
At awb No fca I discuss forens purpos awb assert would put document made avail 
I repeat I said awb No fca concern matter 
howev forens purpos I made refer paragraph I weigh balanc consid exig administr justic present case 
In essenc counsel awb submit report would constitut bodi evid might establish might tend establish depart foreign affair trade dfat knew payment awb stand accus conceal 
In particular submit cole distil admiss evid awb need access document distil deriv order abl tender document trial case busi record 
whilst tender report one import part submiss made behalf awb counsel suggest accept submiss tender document awb case use document might put 
have inspect report read care I firmli view none could tender evid pursuant evid act cth evid act 
whilst awb may well abl satisfi requir respect report abl satisfi person knowledg requir laid sub section 
none report sign 
although report unredact form clearli refer sourc inform possibl attribut particular statement report particular sourc let alon come view whether sourc requisit person knowledg relev fact 
It would thu imposs court confront tender document satisfi requir person knowledg made 
the capac draw infer pursuant evid act would amelior difficulti 
In addit real substanti question whether content report would held suffici relev justifi tender report 
As I point awb No fca awb mention report one document refer australian compani entiti none document specifi wheat trade one except 
that except novemb report suggest larg compani refus pay iraqi impos surcharg cite exampl wheat import australia 
It highli unlik awb would wish tender novemb report I refer 
It also unlik content report would event regard trial suffici relev justifi tender even prima faci admiss evid act 
there also problem exist mask present tender 
although mask may prevent tender least document would probabl case 
I exercis mind whether notwithstand document would abl tender might provid use sourc materi wit intend call applic case might provid basi appropri train enquiri could lead real benefit awb conduct case 
As matter present stand wit might content report Mr othman gener manag alia corpor former foreign minist Mr downer 
It alway difficult judg advanc trial comment upon anticip util document 
counsel brief proceed almost alway better place form view matter judg would 
howev present context I think I least consid whether report could conceiv use two wit I mention respect issu rais proceed said justifi product report grant access parti 
there noth report could directli assist awb two wit 
further extrem difficult discern subtl less direct would appropri serv awb access report 
further I think report provid use train enquiri respect alleg knowledg part dfat relev payment 
consist I said awb No fca mosaic analysi argument argument continu find favour resist awb applic access report 
It extrem difficult judg second guess clear evid effect disclosur content report might lead sort analysi undertaken person repres threat australia nation interest 
In awb No fca I said I accept argument carri much weight time I deliv reason 
that I order report produc court 
now I inspect report consid care I still tend think mosaic analysi argument carri great deal weight present case 
howev reason I discuss I quit firmli view report littl use awb pursuit defenc alleg conceal contain par current statement claim 
In end I think risk harm nation interest outweigh need awb present proceed I propos order access grant person report produc pursuant order I made septemb 
sever report bear particular mark indic anyon dfat report sent 
howev ona commonwealth produc respons order I made septemb statutori declar made purpos cole inquiri
