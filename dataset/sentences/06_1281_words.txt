amongst assess made first month complain ceas work none found complain unabl work 
there later assess contrast held complain total perman disabl 
one latest assess Dr sale opin excess treatment led complain believ psycholog invalid 
In light tribun point distinct someon believ person actual total perman disabl 
the tribun may consid whether open insur consid complain believ total perman disabl fact

logic tribun might consid would unfair unreason insur effect discount later medic assess consider tpd matter accept Dr sale view assess drew upon complain belief state health upon object medic fact 
In word tribun said open insur reason decid complain unlik find regular remun work fit educ etc reason express therebi would logic 
howev tribun make statement subpara b 
instead said open insur decid complain disabl occur activ servic employ 
It obviou tribun made statement 
If meant convey insur might fairli reason form view complain render unabl work extent requir definit tpd time activ servic would requir definit 
As I point definit requir relationship disabl complain like inabl find work relev kind address time insur come consid matter 
It disqualifi origin disabl would ie activ servic justifi conclus 
If hand tribun meant convey insur might fairli reason form view disabl occur complain activ servic employ view would complet odd fact disclos tribun assum state fact seemingli inform insur consider matter 
for reason I would regard latter read tribun reason unlik one 
the matter made complex sentenc commenc word 
here tribun seem refer medic report made first month 
base report tribun express singl opinion unfair unreason matter decid complaint act 
there question whether reason sentenc whatev previou error law found tribun reason discount held unlik affect result 
I return tribun statement correct date assess six month date complain finish work 
As matter construct polici correct statement 
It clear tribun made 
It could mistaken view oper definit tpd polici 
altern could follow tribun mistaken identif definit disabl polici I refer par 
either way seem statement taken erron point law 
that case next question whether error might consequ way tribun went task consid whether insur decis unfair unreason 
As I attempt explain examin succeed part tribun written reason provid clear answer question 
An import element reason within ten month complain ceas work medic opinion provid support proposit total perman disabl 
although passag may tend indic tribun took broader view I believ identifi error law underli tribun determin I treat error consequ determin clear case 
manifestli present case 
In circumst complain cross appeal must upheld 
As appear par I also think like tribun er point law approach case basi polici requir complain total perman disabl activ servic employ 
such error patent howev may said discern reli precis dissect broad thrust tribun decis 
In circumst I prepar go full distanc find tribun err respect 
Mr bingham challeng decis tribun number ground none view disclos error law

Mr bingham submit definit said noth work rather requir work complain might put abl obtain remun work reason fit educ train experi element tribun submiss paid attent 
I consid Mr bingham critic tribun regard involv fastidi pedant concentr upon particular word phrase overlook context mean passag question 
when latter taken account seen passag tribun concern mark singl point distinct definit polici correspond definit rule fund 
both definit requir consid whether like work complain fit educ train experi manifest part tribun reason made decis accord requir

I understand Mr bingham criticis use concept work synonym concept regular work understand sinc client interest definit polici constru way would produc put regim work rather demand might case exampl held encapsul work 
In circumst I consid aspect tribun reason involv error kind much less one law 
As I understood Mr bingham submit separ matter I dealt tribun event error fail consid make explicit find question whether put work complain might abl engag work reason fit educ train experi 
He submit ignor central element definit polici tribun er point law

there error law involv 
final Mr bingham refer number respect submit tribun misunderstood misread medic report 
when report properli understood submit evid tribun could conclud unfair unreason insur decid complain could obtain regular remun work reason fit educ train experi 
the result accord Mr bingham tribun made find fact support therebi er point law

In part submiss Mr bingham deal evid point rather seek court stray beyond limit role make find valid factual conclus tribun drew basi medic report view invit court observ medic evid support tribun conclus 
such approach need expos way obviou long way distant discern error law tribun decis 
It might also said Mr bingham submiss present respect betray attempt cast tribun role investig question whether origin decis insur right wrong
