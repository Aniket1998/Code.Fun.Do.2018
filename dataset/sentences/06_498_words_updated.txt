issu ON appeal An appeal feder magistr court decis appeal way 
the power appel court exercis appel demonstr regard evid appel court order subject appeal result legal factual discretionari error abeyesingh v minist immigr multicultur indigen affair fca 
On appeal appel alleg number jurisdict error base purport practic rmit comment whether result satisfactori 
the appel contend tribun inform rmit polici provid academ result without comment whether result satisfactori 
In light polici appel submit strict complianc condit possibl open tribun make find whether appel achiev substanti complianc condit gurung v minist immigr multicultur indigen affair fca gurung 
the appel submit tribun properli make find whether appel result satisfactori rather reli opinion rmit staff whose statement appel academ perform contrari rmit establish procedur 
these circumst said appel give rise jurisdict error two base 
first appel submit tribun reli upon opinion express staff member rmit whether appel result year satisfactori know give opinion contrari rmit establish procedur 
thi said jurisdict error sever way includ denial procedur fair relianc upon irrelev materi 
there substanc content essenti reason given hartnett FM 
the basi content rmit establish procedur express opinion whether result satisfactori seem flimsi say least 
It appear base entir upon telephon convers tribun offic intern student offic rmit 
the suggest consist formal advic sent tribun head relev depart rmit 
but event whatev practic rmit might condit requir visa holder achiev academ result certifi educ provid least satisfactori 
the second alleg jurisdict error said base upon misappl gurung 
In gurung tamberlin J state requir holder visa achiev academ result certifi educ provid least satisfactori 
cours run least semest term semest cours 
In present case certif make find tribun usurp encroach upon provinc educ institut 
On face clearli open tribun make find academ perform applic satisfactori regard high failur rate 
At hear counsel appel sought argu gurung stand proposit absenc certif academ result educ provid tribun made find substanti complianc condit regard applic failur rate percentag number subject appel sat 
counsel assert appel pass five six subject sat said failur rate 
counsel submit failur rate better appel failur rate first semest 
per cent period rmit certifi appel achiev satisfactori result 
On basi calcul submit rmit statement concern appel academ result intern inconsist tribun misdirect reli statement 
the factual basi submiss appear entir misconceiv 
the failur rate calcul counsel ignor subject appel sit examin withdraw 
As tribun rightli found subject must taken account consid whether appel achiev satisfactori result 
the tribun correctli found appel achiev seven subject undertook academ year 
those subject compris five pass one fail nine appel sit two exempt 
the next step appel submiss also misconceiv 
counsel appel contend consid question whether substanti complianc condit decis gurung requir tribun confin examin appel academ result rather assess appel academ progress 
In opinion misread gurung tamberlin J case held open tribun find applic substanti compli condit regard applic high failur rate 
hi honour suggest tribun must regard sole applic failur rate express percentag number subject appel sat assess whether substanti complianc condit see kim v witton fcr 
rmit certifi appel result least satisfactori 
As hartnett FM state certif provid regard evid appel academ result 
there ampl evid appel poor academ perform present case rmit opinion appel result unsatisfactori 
In view clearli open tribun find appel fail substanti compli condit relev period 
the tribun misdirect error disclos hartnett FM accept tribun find
