I observ arriv recov compens loss chanc retain client recov incom lost client well compens loss chanc retain client 
thu may necessari make adjust claim 
the task determin whether arriv chanc retain client move gsjbw place dollar valu chanc 
arriv say appropri strategi like retain per cent client left 
Mr regan former gener manag within amp group outlin strategi could adopt 
first busi would write client advis resign Ms man assur valu client busi forewarn affair would continu manag busi alloc replac planner offer arrang meet 
Ms man would requir attend meet advis client discuss propos arrang 
the meet would involv Ms man person inform client resign explain circumst contractu restraint reason could continu provid financi plan servic recommend replac planner assur client high qualiti servic would continu provid busi 
In addit measur Mr regan said pwc might call assist client relationship date back time busi own pwc 
Mr regan said strategi could implement soon becam awar Ms man approach client encourag move gsjbw 
In fact event turn letter sent client advis resign staff member appoint two new financi advis intent arriv continu provid premium qualiti wealth manag advic arriv look ed forward continu servic assist financi affair 
In opinion Mr regan suggest strategi never implement 
immedi upon Ms man give notic Mr reid Mr fur came sydney took charg melbourn oper 
they remain charg Mr regan took januari 
neither Mr reid Mr fur call pwc assist deal client 
Mr helmich director amp servic put call senior partner pwc sought assur pwc would continu refer client arriv 
that assur given 
Mr helmich ask assist 
So far client concern Mr fur request advis call client advis Ms man left reassur would replac busi usual arriv 
He told advis client want know Ms man gone evas 
but one appoint replac Ms man undertak Ms man duti regard particular client 
when Mr regan took control noth week spoke Ms man see whether might chang mind 
By time Mr regan reach conclus Ms man would return arriv perhap earli second week februari letter begun arriv client advis intent move 
To point approxim two half week elaps seriou attempt made keep client leav 
even letter began arriv noth done 
It may accept arriv littl chanc entic client said would follow Ms man chang mind 
but client letter receiv moreov earli februari arriv way know mani client decid go 
nor anyon realli appreci Ms man caus mani client decid leav

In earlier reason I said albeit tent basi given close relationship Ms man client like would follow gsjbw 
noth said second trial alter preliminari view 
the second potenti reason felt arriv need noth belief mistaken turn Ms man subject restraint trade claus oper twelv month 
It necessari choos possibl consequ 
the valu lost client must consid perspect potenti purchas Mr kenyon word will pay incom stream confid continu receiv forese futur 
from moment Ms man tender resign reason purchas would regard incom receiv Ms man client
