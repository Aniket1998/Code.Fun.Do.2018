 Background These reasons deal with questions of costs arising out of judgment in the principal proceeding: Uniline Australia Ltd v SBriggs Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 222; (2009) 81 IPR 42.Orders were made for the filing of further submissions in relation to costs and additional submissions were made by the parties in relation to the potential application of the reasoning of the Full Court in PAC Mining Pty Ltd v Esco Corporation (No.2) [2009] FCAFC 52 to the resolution of the present issues on costs.In the principal proceeding the applicant ("Uniline") sought a declaration that threats of patent infringement proceedings made by the respondent ("SBriggs") were unjustifiable; an injunction restraining SBriggs from making further threats of such proceedings; and damages arising out of those threats.The threats were contained in a letter dated 4 April 2007 from the solicitors for SBriggs to Uniline and a letter dated 16 July 2007 from those solicitors to Uniline's patent attorneys.SBriggs contended that the threats were not unjustified as Uniline had sold and offered for sale a product described in the principal judgment as the Uniline spring clutch which was said to contain each and every essential integer of claim 13 of the patent in suit.By an amended cross-claim, SBriggs sought a declaration of infringement of claim 13 by Uniline; an injunction restraining continuing infringement; an order for delivery up of all infringing products; and damages and related relief.By its defence, Uniline in response to the amended cross-claim, contended that claim 13 of the patent claimed as an essential integer of a spring clutch the subject of the patent, a particular component described as a helical spring wound according to any one of claims 1 to 12 of the patent in suit which, properly construed, described a helical spring of unitary construction, that is, a single unitary spring.Uniline contended that since the spring clutch it sold and offered for sale did not embody a single unitary helical spring but operated by reason of a section of the clutch device engaging, in a particular manner, separate helically wound springs, an essential integer of claim 13 was not present in the Uniline spring clutch and thus no infringement of claim 13 arose.Uniline conceded, subject to its amended further cross-claim, that if claim 13 of the patent described, as a matter of construction, a spring clutch that comprised three separate springs assembled within a spring clutch in the manner assembled within Exhibit 1 in the proceedings, infringement of claim 13 of a patent would be made out.By its amended further cross-claim, Uniline contended that claims 1 to 13 of the patent in suit were invalid on grounds of lack of novelty; lack of sufficient clarity; failure to fairly base each claim on matters disclosed in the specification; lack of utility; obtaining the grant of the claims by false suggestion or misrepresentation; and obtaining on 23 March 2007 by false suggestion and misrepresentation, an amendment to claims 13 and 14 of the patent and the deletion of claim 15 of the patent.Uniline also contended that claims 1 to 13 of the patent were invalid on the ground that the claims did not disclose any inventive step when compared to the prior art base.This allegation was withdrawn by Uniline at a directions hearing on 26 March 2008.Uniline also sought relief in respect of contended unjustified threats of infringement proceedings of Australian Registered Design No.131578.The proceeding as initially framed also sought relief in respect of misleading and deceptive conduct in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).The contentions in relation to misleading and deceptive conduct were withdrawn by Uniline by consent at a directions hearing on 26 March 2008.A declaration that threats of infringement of the Registered Design were unjustified, was made by the Court on 17 April 2008.The costs of that part of the proceeding were reserved.SBriggs was the exclusive licensee of the patent in suit.The second cross-respondent, Mr Carmelo Di Stefano, was the patentee of the patent in suit.In the result, the following orders were made. THE COURT DECLARES THAT:  The threat made by SBriggs Pty Ltd by a letter from its solicitors to Uniline Australia Ltd on 4 April 2007 of bringing infringement proceedings against Uniline Australia Ltd for infringement of claim 13 of Australian Patent No.706458 is unjustifiable.The threat made by SBriggs Pty Ltd by a letter from its solicitors to Uniline Australia Ltd, by its patent attorneys, on 16 July 2007 of bringing infringement proceedings against Uniline Australia Ltd for infringement of claim 13 of Australian Patent No.706458 is unjustifiable. THE COURT ORDERS THAT:  SBriggs Pty Ltd be restrained by itself, its directors, employees or agents from making any further threats of patent infringement proceedings in respect of Australia Patent No.706458 to Uniline Australia Ltd or any party acting on behalf of Uniline Australia Ltd.  The Amended Cross-Claim of SBriggs Pty Ltd by which it seeks relief in relation to contended infringement of claim 13 of Australian Patent No.706458 by Uniline Australia Ltd is dismissed.The Amended Further Cross-Claim of Uniline Australia Ltd by which it seeks revocation of Australian Patent No.706458 is dismissed.The costs of the proceeding are reserved for determination upon receipt of further submissions.The application is adjourned generally for the making of further directions in relation to those claims for relief to be determined separately.It can be seen therefore that Uniline succeeded in the principal application and obtained declarations in relation to the unjustified threats of 4 April 2007 and 16 July 2007 and an injunction restraining SBriggs or its agents or otherwise from making further threats.Uniline successfully resisted SBriggs's cross-claim of infringement of the patent.Uniline's amended further cross-claim asserting invalidity of the patent was dismissed.In support of its submissions on costs, Uniline relies upon the affidavit of Mr Bentley Coogan, a member of the firm of solicitors acting for Uniline.Mr Coogan exhibits a notice of offer of compromise made to SBriggs through its solicitors on 20 March 2008.The offer is in these terms:  The Applicant/First Cross-Respondent/Further Cross-Claimant ( Applicant ) [Uniline] offers to compromise these proceedings on the following terms:   1.There be orders that:   1.1 The Respondent/Cross-Claimant/First Further Cross-Respondent's and Second Cross-Respondent/Second Further Cross-Respondent's ( Respondents ) Cross-Claim be dismissed.  1.2 The Applicant's Application and Further Cross-Claim be dismissed upon terms that the dismissal of the Further Cross-Claim shall be without prejudice to the right of the Applicant to bring fresh proceedings for unjustified threats of patent and/or design infringement (in relation to the Patent and Design the subject of these proceedings) or proceedings for the revocation of the Patent in the event that:   (a) the Respondents make any threat to commence fresh proceedings against the Applicant for infringement of the Patent or Design;   (b) the Respondents commence any fresh proceedings against the Applicant for infringement of the Patent or the Design; or   (c) the Court gives the Applicant leave to do so.  1.3 Each party pay its own costs of these proceedings. The Applicant pay the Respondent the amount of $1,000 within 14 days of acceptance of this offer.For the avoidance of doubt, it is noted and agreed that the dismissal of the Cross-Claim as provided for in paragraph 1.1 above will operate as a bar to any fresh proceedings against the Applicant for infringement of the Patent based upon the use, manufacture or supply by the Applicant of the UNIdrive spring clutch assembly, the subject of these proceedings.This offer will remain open to be accepted for a period of 14 days beginning on the day after it is made.This offer of compromise is made under Order 23 of the Federal Court Rules and is made without prejudice.
