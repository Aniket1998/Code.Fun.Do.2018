that occur exampl johnson tile pti ltd v esso australia ltd fca fcr 
nonetheless I inform parti proper way matter dealt open court 
inde matter reach stage requir matter heard publicli 
In meantim I began examin author guidanc 
I could find author consid precis posit

I came across two decis particularli import 
In certain underwrit cir appel decis ipo case refer secur class action investor initi public offer stock market boom late su recov loss issuer underwrit broker alleg widespread manipul ipo market 
the class whose behalf action brought includ investor bought stock particular date 
the judg member class purchas stock one defend well compani may connect defend 
the judg sold stock compani waiv interest pursu claim 
the court appeal second circuit refus issu mandamu judg 
the court refer usc f said judg minor interest class action consid parti divest interest 
nor accord judg sharehold suggest partial object disinterest observ 
In literari work electron databas copyright litig cir concern settlement class action brought behalf freelanc author whose work reproduc without consent 
the settlement approv district court 
An appeal approv second circuit court appeal came panel three judg two member plaintiff class entitl share settlement sum 
instead said open court would forgo interest settlement suffici get rid appear bia 
At time seem approach I adopt 
accordingli I arrang motown sell cnp share 
I assum line US case plu waiver claim aris relat fact alleg plead would cure vestigi appear bia 
with step attend I strong convict respond posit wrong 
when matter came hear I advis parti share sold 
thi inform I anticip would appeas anyon 
To contrari seem inflammatori affect although one would expect counsel submiss restrain 
the princip point made counsel Dr pannam QC centro retail limit centro mc manag limit Mr uren QC cnp cpt manag limit motown crystal loss I extent victim applic say respond wrong conduct lay observ might still think I would favour applic interest centro group 
that say submit even though I divest pecuniari interest parti cnp caus ie outcom litig reason apprehens bia said stem grudg I might perceiv bear due forev unrecover loss real could cure 
frankli I given content much weight first rais freehil letter 
one reason victim point occur member full court johnson tile two prior amend plead posit similar member repres group 
second read unit state case I view content merit cur divestitur made 
third case seem say lay observ Mr uren QC refer joe sixpack must regard chanc judg bear grudg way Dr pannam QC put fairli high must high probabl favourit inconsist fair perform judg duti R v australian stevedor hca clr 
As high court said case apprehend bia must real 
see also Re polit hca clr 
At time I see anyon might reason ascrib high probabl I would show favourit base fact I set 
howev time counsel conclud submiss I confess doubt matter 
what earlier seem quit clear becom murki 
My view lay observ would appreci regard experi qualif judg well high standard independ must conform judg would abl decid case fairli even victim action subject complaint 
No doubt judg johnson tile view 
but I suppos possibl lay observ would see thing differ 
the problem I think sometim difficult judg know lay observ might think particular issu 
moreov closer read high court case suggest bia test much stricter necessari establish high probabl bia demonstr reason apprehens real instead lower probabl suffic case involv alleg interest oppos say alleg prejudg see eg australian stevedor note case involv alleg bia interest except high probabl formul test 
In face consider I decid end I recus 
I consid case present real doubt matter better cours cautiou see ebner counsel n case real doubt often prudent judg decid sit order avoid inconveni could result appel court take differ view matter disqualif 
As suggest ebner I first instanc judg consid consid possibl respond would appeal refus recus 
I make clear I troubl possibl appel court might taken differ view I refus recus 
what concern howev delay appeal would caus well addit cost parti would incur alreadi expens piec litig 
what highlight sever problem 
first test recus laid high court state quit clear term applic particular fact far clear 
some refin necessari perhap even statut 
If unit state model adopt least everyon know stand see ebner per kirbi J counsel adopt statutori approach recus 
second problem murki case give parti opportun go 
It possibl among other sever occas high court said judg lightli recus see eg ebner state mere make insubstanti object suffici lead judg declin hear decid case system would soon reach stage practic purpos individu parti could influenc composit bench hat would intoler 
hand case anoth judg I take away opportun deal quit interest procedur issu aris class action 
still one interest procedur matter I address conclud 
I said outset I sever motion recus 
there author view judg ordinarili must entertain formal motion disqualif ground bia see eg idoport pti limit v nation australia bank ltd nswsc cite among case barton v walker nswlr australian nation industri ltd v spedley secur ltd liq nswlr rajski v wood nswlr 
thi line author recent lee v cha nswca taken support view although judg may publish reason refus recus independ appeal lie prerog writ avail rather parti must wait subsequ appeal order made time failur recus rais point error underli subsequ order 
whether barton line case bind question I shall come moment 
I start howev say reason case without problem notwithstand I member full bench feder court approv barton see parramatta design develop pti ltd v concret pti ltd fcr revers ground hca clr 
for one thing reason circular primari reason given order appeal parti seek disqualif allow bring motion 
To say said idoport quot barton formal applic disqualif must entertain beyond doubt judg court might reason suspect bia hear caus justif rule rather restat problem 
the question alway whether suspicion bia reason done 
In view public interest see justic done openli best serv allow alway mandat recus applic brought public motion whatev process requir see alleg fulli ventil 
the solut offer idoport allow indirect appeal refus recus judg simpli make whatev order might conveni parti may take appeal order attract 
onc concess made numer court see idoport ga fuel corpor superannu fund v saunder fcr parramatta fcr circumst interlocutori appeal base refus recus desir court forc make pretextu order order facilit appel review It much cleaner simpli allow appeal everyon know actual decis challeng 
thi would also make unnecessari parti appli high court prohibit 
It seem event barton doubt author 
In brook v the upjohn compani fcr full feder court gave variou ground abandon rule barton 
see also bahonko v nurs board victoria No fca cite author support view permiss seek disqualif judg notic motion wit v marsden nswlr acknowledg disagr suggest barton might requir reconsider see lee v cha nswca discuss contradictori author reaffirm barton reject brook albeit dictum 
I also point parramatta full court cite barton neither acknowledg address tension case brook 
most like extent court parramatta appear approv barton approv peripher unnecessari relev hold trial judg earlier decis relat recus request foreclos revisit decis light fresh materi parramatta 
thi proposit correct unremark gener matter interlocutori order may subject reconsider trial court prior make final order 
It difficult know trial judg full court jurisdict brook cast doubt dictum author anoth full court judgment outsid jurisdict barton yet third full court jurisdict dictum parramatta prefer barton 
fortun I entertain motion I think need order made 
It would odd legal unsound Mr uren point direct hear case 
On hand I see noth would prevent circumv problem simpli frame recus term order grant respond motion 
In end howev I make direct case alloc anoth judg 
I certifi preced number paragraph true copi reason judgment herein honour justic finkelstein
