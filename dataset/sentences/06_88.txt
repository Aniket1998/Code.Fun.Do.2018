 1 This is an application for an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 10 August 2005.The Federal Magistrate dismissed an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal of 18 March 2004.The Federal Magistrate did so on the basis that the application for judicial review was incompetent since the Tribunal's decision was a privative clause decision and the time had expired in which any application for judicial review could be made.In my opinion, the Federal Magistrate was correct in reaching that conclusion.It was reached against a background in which there had been earlier litigation, in the Federal Magistrates Court, the Federal Court and the High Court, concerning the Tribunal's decision.2 In my view, the applicant has no prospects of succeeding in any appeal if time were to be extended and leave given.In those circumstances, the application is refused with costs.I certify that the preceding two (2) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Moore.Associate:
