first point It opinion posit applic multipl purpos engag conduct australia matter rel unimport purpos may exist prevent regard 
In differ context result might avoid familiar techniqu statutori construct constru purpos mean real substanti purpos see eg 
district council coober pedi v collector custom fca fcr 
howev simpl solut would still leav problem

emphasi ad 
In opinion problem refer adequ overcom real mischief concern legisl framer met interpret purpos mean domin purpos 
the second read speech give sharper account mischief subsect aim explanatori memorandum support approach I favour 
the context gener speak give statut interpret 
there textual well contextu support statut approach 
the statutori test whether person concern engag conduct otherwis purpos strengthen claim refuge statu 
the use word rather suggest singl purpos regard purpos 
In real world behaviour commonli multipl motiv purpos fulfil statutori notion would suffici read purpos way I propos also lesser way 
that obvious say appel would wherev multipl purpos matter strong purpos simpli aid one case appli 
I therefor think draconian construct favour court erron 
that error howev opinion avail appel 
In first place honour may er mean clear tribun 
secondli respond point tribun affirm found satisfi applic engag relev conduct 


otherwis purpos strengthen refuge claim emphasi ad 
that constru I conceiv would still requir conduct disregard 
In necessari exercis discret whether constitut writ go I would reason declin relief sought 
second point disregard purpos conduct purpos strengthen claim again correct understand tribun member reason find error tribun understand opinion quit immateri

the tribun spoke exampl whether leav asid conduct appel genuin sustain interest higher order religi practic

I agre respond analysi tribun reject appel sur place motiv belief relev regard conduct indic like higher profil return china previous tribun find 
I accept respond seem done sub silentio driver FM point szhay fmca szjsd fmca correct word disregard subsect admit ambigu
