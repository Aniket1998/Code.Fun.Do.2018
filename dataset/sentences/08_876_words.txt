follow deliveri judgment I found ajinomoto patent invalid obvious ajinomoto appli recal judgment reopen case argument

In small measur cost incur amend applic signific parti gear determin whether propos new claim also fail lack invent step bad lack fair basi lack util

nutrasweet took posit I requir find claim propos amend claim propos new claim invalid reason find purport invent obviou 
howev find prevent ajinomoto assert new claim invent nutrasweet file expert evid tender hear

ajinomoto also file evid relat obvious 
ajinomoto adopt posit estoppel oper confin old claim 
insofar propos new claim concern ajinomoto contend would necessari look afresh question invent step 
It made clear go invit reconsid previou rule find I made regard 
In separ written submiss ajinomoto put way the amend applic requir court conduct retrial invent step question albeit limit propos new claim the reopen applic requir reconsider exist evid invent step issu 
now event turn hear commenc parti chang posit 
first nutrasweet indic follow chang draft new claim longer press object discretionari ground 
later indic would call expert evid 
it sole opposit propos amend applic made abus process 
To fair counsel nutrasweet transcript suggest reason put egg one basket light argument progress thought like would succeed upon abus ground 
I said side gave ground 
for part ajinomoto drop content would relat propos new claim reargu invalid find gone trial 
I mean suggest ajinomoto conced point law prevent argu new claim obviou 
It simpli decid would argu point 
ajinomoto contend end nutrasweet confin object amend sole ground abus process nutrasweet recov cost incur prepar ground 
those cost would includ discoveri prepar affidavit travel accommod wit 
I firm view I adopt ajinomoto approach 
I might inclin I thought point rais nutrasweet abandon bad point 
but I think 
the formal object cure ajinomoto decis amend propos claim 
the fight invent proceed nutrasweet withdrew contest 
but gone ahead like nutrasweet would success 
the result side give ground alreadi prolong piec litig brought rapidli end 
As result ajinomoto nutrasweet cost significantli reduc 
but reason ajinomoto get discount cost otherwis pay 
one lose sight likelihood case gone ahead ground ajinomoto would liabl pay much higher cost 
the issu caus difficulti whether nutrasweet cost indemn basi 
I need discuss applic principl well known 
In short case say court depart requir cost paid parti parti basi interest justic requir 
one circumst indemn order made case chanc success action hopeless 
It said applic reopen case hopeless 
It one point favour 
On amend applic I go ask reconsid invent left open possibl inconsist find I chang mind 
that suffici suggest merit make applic reopen case 
In event I think applic ad greatli cost otherwis incur 
I declin make indemn cost order amend applic differ reason 
It march six day trial nutrasweet amend ground object includ ground abus process 
By time case readi trial cost parti incur 
If notic ground given earlier ajinomoto would time give due consider decid proceed might basi seek indemn cost 
but I would acced applic case success ground first rais immedi trial 
for forego reason nutrasweet cost applic amend applic reopen cost tax parti parti basi
