  1 On 5 July 2006 I made orders pursuant to s 411(1) of the Corporation Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act"), that NRG London Reinsurance Company Limited ("NRG London") and NRG Victory Australia Limited ("NRG Victory") convene meetings of their respective "Scheme Creditors": see NRG London Reinsurance Company Ltd, in the matter of NRG Victory Aust Ltd and the Corporations Act 2001 [2006] FCA 872.In the present reasons, words and expressions have the same meanings as they had in the earlier reasons for judgment, where the background facts are set out.2 The two Scheme Meetings were held on 15 August 2006.Affidavit evidence shows that the orders of 5 July 2006 relating to notifications and advertisements for the meetings have been complied with.The Scheme Creditors at each meeting agreed to the relevant Scheme by the required majority.3 A question was raised at the NRG Victory meeting whether Ross Littlewood was able to administer the NRG Victory Scheme, given his position as a director of NRG Victory.Mr Littlewood is one of three directors of NRG Victory.He is also the Australian agent of NRG London for the purposes of s 118 of the Insurance Act 1973 (Cth) and describes himself as the "principal director" of Littlewoods Services Pty Ltd, which has provided "various administrative services" to NRG London since 1974 and to NRG Victory since 1994.He states that those services included "representation, technical accounting, claims settlement, cash processing and statutory record keeping and accounting".4 Subsection 411(7) of the Act provides as follows:   "(7) Except with the leave of the Court, a person must not be appointed to administer, and must not administer, a compromise or arrangement approved under this Act between a body and its creditors or any class of them or between a body and its members or any class of them, whether by the terms of that compromise or arrangement or pursuant to a power given by the terms of a compromise or arrangement, if the person:  (a) is a mortgagee of any property of the body; or  (b) is an auditor of the body; or  (ba) is a director, secretary, senior manager or employee of the body; or    (c) is a director, secretary, senior manager or employee of a body corporate that is a mortgagee of property of the body; or    (d) is not a registered liquidator; or    (e) is a director, secretary, senior manager or employee of a body corporate related to the body; or  (f) unless ASIC directs in writing that this paragraph does not apply in relation to the person in relation to the body--has at any time within the last 12 months been an officer or promoter of the body or of a related body corporate."    This subsection refers to appointments or administrations after a scheme has been approved by the Court.However, Mr Owens, counsel for the plaintiffs, while contending that the role played by Mr Littlewood as a director of NRG Victory does not signify that he will be administering the NRG Victory Scheme, asks that, if I should take a different view, leave be granted to Mr Littlewood to administer that scheme.5 I agree with Mr Owens that the mere fact that Mr Littlewood will continue to be, and will act as, a director of NRG Victory does not signify that he will be administering the NRG Victory Scheme.6 The notion of what it means to administer a compromise or arrangement for the purposes of subs 411(7) is not defined in the Act.In the present case, the general administrator of the NRG Victory Scheme is NRG Victory itself.Mr Littlewood is only one of three directors of that company even though his knowledge and his role in the past no doubt signify that he is, and will continue to be, a key person in terms of the day-to-day administration of the company.There is, however, nothing to suggest that his co-directors act at his behest or that directorial decisions are not taken by the three directors 7 While I do not give an advisory opinion (even the granting of leave would not protect Mr Littlewood if he should step outside the terms of the leave granted), in deciding whether to approve the Schemes I have come to the view that Mr Littlewood's mere status as one of three directors of NRG Victory, coupled with the fact that his company, Littlewoods Services Pty Ltd, may continue to provide administrative services to that company, do not, without more, indicate that Mr Littlewood will be administering the NRG Victory Scheme.8 There may be a question whether Mark Moyes and Scott Collings will be administering certain aspects of the Schemes, and, therefore, to the extent necessary, I will grant them leave to do so, even though they are not registered liquidators.9 Both Schemes should be approved.I make orders 1 to 5 of short minutes of order initialled by me, dated today and placed with the papers.I certify that the preceding nine (9) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lindgren.Associate:
