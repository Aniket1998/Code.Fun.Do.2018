 INTRODUCTION  3 The plaintiffs ("the Scheme Companies") apply for orders pursuant to s 411(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Corporations Act ") that meetings of their respective creditors be convened for the purpose of considering and, if thought fit, approving schemes of arrangement between them and those creditors.They also seek an order approving the form of the Explanatory Statement for the schemes, and providing for the manner in which the meetings are to be held.4 The Scheme Companies are insurance companies.Their businesses are in the nature of reinsurance and are in run-off.In broad terms, the purpose of each scheme is to accelerate the payment of reinsurance claims that have been made, or might be in the future, so as to resolve their potential reinsurance now, and to enable their businesses to be terminated."CUT-OFF" OR "VALUATION" SCHEMES GENERALLY  5 Schemes such as the present ones are referred to as "cut-off" or "valuation" schemes.While there have been several in England in recent years, this appears to be only the second in Australia, the first being the subject of Conti J's judgment in Re Mercantile Mutual Insurance (Australia) Ltd (" MMIA ") (2002) 196 ALR 362.6 Three general features of the proposed schemes may be noted: 2#8226; first, the liabilities of the Scheme Companies to be subject to the schemes are all reinsurance liabilities.Accordingly, the "Scheme Creditors" will all be insurance companies or similar entities, that can be expected to be commercially sophisticated and knowledgeable, particularly in relation to the reinsurance considerations involved in any assessment of the schemes; 2#8226; secondly, the business of both companies has been in run-off for a long time; and 2#8226; thirdly, in the case of each Scheme Company there is a clear surplus of assets over liabilities.7 In my view, the Scheme Companies must establish:   a. first , that all reasonable steps have been or will be taken to identify the Scheme Creditors and to bring the proposed schemes to the attention of all of them, and that it seems likely that their efforts in these respects will prove successful; b. secondly , that the Explanatory Statement for the proposed schemes provides an adequate description of their effect, and otherwise complies with s 412(1) of the Corporations Act ; c. thirdly , that the manner in which the proposed schemes will operate is not so clearly unfair and unreasonable that they should not be allowed to go forward for consideration; d. fourthly , that it is appropriate that there be, as proposed, a single meeting of all the Scheme Creditors of each Scheme Company as distinct from meetings of classes of Scheme Creditors; e. fifthly , that the way in which the value of Scheme Creditors' claims will be determined for the purposes of voting at the meeting of the Scheme Creditors for each Scheme Company is fair and reasonable; f. sixthly , that the proposed schemes comply with the requirements of other provisions of the Corporations Act , including the requirement of s 411(2) that 14 days' notice of the hearing of the application be given to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC") and that ASIC has had a reasonable opportunity to examine the proposed schemes and explanatory memorandum, and to make submissions to the Court in relation to them; g. seventhly , that the Scheme Companies have provided or will provide full disclosure concerning the proposed schemes, not only to the Scheme Creditors, to ASIC and to the Court, but also to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority ("APRA"), and that APRA has also had a reasonable opportunity to examine the documents and to make submissions to the Court concerning them.  THE SCHEME COMPANIES  NRG London Reinsurance Company Limited  8 NRG London Reinsurance Company Limited ("NRG London") is incorporated in the United Kingdom.It is an indirect subsidiary of ING Groep NV, a Netherlands incorporated and listed company.9 NRG London was an active reinsurer until 1991, when it ceased underwriting new risks, and was placed into run-off.10 As at 31 December 2005, NRG London had total assets of GBP 164,821,000 and total liabilities of GBP 108,500,000 (giving an excess of assets over liabilities of GBP 56,321,000).NRG London (Australian Branch)  11 NRG London is registered in Australia as a foreign corporation under Part 5B.2 of the Corporations Act and is licensed as a general insurer under the Insurance Act 1973 (Cth) ("the Insurance Act ").Registration of a foreign corporation under the Corporations Act does not create a new legal entity (s 601BM).However, because APRA regulates only the Australian operations of NRG London, it is necessary to distinguish between its Australian and non-Australian operations.12 APRA is concerned with the protection of NRG London's Australian policyholders.There is a general requirement under s 28 of the Insurance Act that insurers maintain "in Australia" (as to which see s 116A of that Act) assets at least equal to the value of their liabilities.Prudential Standards made under the Insurance Act require foreign insurers to maintain assets in Australia in excess of their liabilities in Australia, in an amount at least equal to their "Minimum Capital Requirement": Prudential Standard GPS 110 , para 25 and Prudential Standard GPS 120 , para 18.NRG London must, therefore, maintain a balance sheet for its Australian operations.The accounts so prepared depict the financial condition of a notional entity referred to as a "branch": see Prudential Standard GPS 110 , para.25.13 The notional division between NRG London's Australian operations and its other operations is reinforced by restrictions that APRA places on NRG London's ability to deal with its Australian assets.NRG London may not reduce its Australian assets (save to the extent of current-year profits) without APRA approval: Prudential Standard GPS 110 , paras.6 and 25; Guidance Note GGN 110.1 , paras 20-22.14 In this way, APRA "quarantines" within Australia assets sufficient to meet NRG London's Australian liabilities.APRA is therefore able to ignore NRG London's non-Australian assets and liabilities.NRG London's Australian assets must not be applied, without APRA approval, towards satisfying its other non-Australian liabilities.(It is possible that NRG London's Australian policyholders may benefit from NRG London's non-Australian operations, in the sense that, at least so far as Australian law is concerned, NRG London remains obliged, and, subject to any contrary requirement of foreign law, able to apply its non-Australian assets towards satisfying its Australian liabilities).15 For the above reasons, it is convenient to refer to the "Australian branch" of NRG London ("NRG London (Australian Branch ) ") as if it were a separate legal entity.For the purposes of these proceedings, for example, because the liabilities of NRG London that are to be subject to the scheme are only those "in Australia", it is convenient to refer to them as liabilities of the NRG London (Australian Branch).16 NRG London (Australian Branch) was established in September 1973, and was an active reinsurer in the Australian market between 1974 and 1991.In 1991, NRG London (Australian Branch) was placed into run-off.Accordingly, it has now been in run-off for approximately the last 15 years.If the NRG London scheme is eventually implemented, NRG London (Australian Branch) will no longer be carrying on business.17 As at 31 December 2005 NRG London (Australian Branch) had total assets of AUD 21,321,000 and total liabilities of AUD 7,211,000.(an excess of assets over liabilities of AUD 14,110,000).NRG Victory Australia Limited  18 NRG Victory Australia Limited ("NRG Victory") is incorporated in Victoria.It is also an indirect subsidiary of ING Groep NV.19 NRG Victory was an active reinsurer in the Australian market between 1956 and 1993, writing both life insurance and reinsurance, and non-life reinsurance.20 In 1993, NRG Victory ceased underwriting new risks.Unsuccessful attempts were made to sell the company as a composite insurer, and NRG Victory's life business was transferred to Life Reinsurance of Australia Limited pursuant to a scheme under the Life Insurance Act 1945 (Cth) ("the Life Insurance Act").NRG Victory's non-life reinsurance business remained and was placed into run-off.21 Accordingly, NRG Victory's business has been in run-off for the last 12 to 13 years.If the NRG Victory scheme is eventually implemented, NRG Victory will no longer be carrying on business.22 As at 31 December 2005, NRG Victory had total assets of AUD 47,268,000 and total liabilities of AUD 12,905,000 (an excess of assets over liabilities of 34,363,000).THE PROPOSED SCHEMES  23 With two exceptions, the two proposed schemes are identical.The first exception relates to the way in which the Scheme Creditors are defined.The second relates to the value of Scheme Creditors' claims, above which the respective Scheme Companies have a discretion to terminate the scheme and to "revert to run-off".The Scheme Creditors  24 In each scheme, the Scheme Creditors are creditors of the particular Scheme Company in respect of a "Claim".A person has a Claim against a Scheme Company if the Scheme Company has a liability to that person under a contract of reinsurance, unless the liability falls within the expression "Excluded Liabilities".25 Each scheme defines Excluded Liabilities differently.In the NRG London scheme, Excluded Liabilities are all liabilities of NRG London under contracts of reinsurance that were not written through NRG London (Australian Branch).26 In the NRG Victory scheme, Excluded Liabilities are all liabilities under contracts of life reinsurance that were transferred to Life Reinsurance of Australasia Limited by way of the scheme under the Life Insurance Act in late 1993 (mentioned at [18] above).Strictly, it is unnecessary to exclude such liabilities, since NRG Victory is no longer liable on those contracts.They were expressly excluded "for abundant precaution".The Compromise or Arrangement  27 In the absence of the proposed schemes, the Scheme Companies' liabilities to the Scheme Creditors would be discharged in response to the making and assessment of claims over a lengthy period of time.Under the proposed schemes, all potential entitlements to reinsurance indemnity that a Scheme Creditor has against a Scheme Company will be valued and paid out now.The Process by which the Value of Claims will be Determined  28 The first step in the determination of the value of Scheme Creditors' claims is the submission of a "Claim Form".29 Where it has sufficient information to do so, the Scheme Company will pre-complete a Claim Form stating its estimate of the value of the Scheme Creditor's claim.If the Scheme Creditor agrees with the estimate, it need take no further action.30 If the Scheme Company has not pre-completed a Claim Form, or if the Scheme Creditor disagrees with the Scheme Company's estimate, the Scheme Creditor will itself complete the Claim Form and submit it to the Scheme Company along with any relevant supporting information.31 In order to assist the Scheme Companies, the Scheme Adjudicator (see below), and the Scheme Creditors in valuing claims, an "Estimation Methodology" has been prepared by Scott Collings, of Finity Consulting Pty Limited.Mr Collings is a Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries of Australia.He is the actuary appointed by NRG London (Australian Branch) and NRG Victory pursuant to s 39 of the Insurance Act and approved by APRA pursuant to s 40 of that Act.The Estimation Methodology is not a binding statement of the manner in which claims will be valued.It is, however, a statement of what Mr Collings believes is an appropriate actuarial approach to the valuation of most of the claims expected to be made.The Estimation Methodology is set out in Section 5 of the Scheme Booklet to be distributed to Scheme Creditors.32 If the Scheme Company agrees with the value assigned by the Scheme Creditor, that amount will become the value of the claim.If the Scheme Company does not agree, and discussions do not produce agreement, the question of the value of the claim will be submitted to a "Scheme Adjudicator".33 The Scheme Adjudicator will consider all relevant information, may consult with advisers, such as actuaries and lawyers, and will determine the value of the claim.34 Once the value of a claim is agreed or is determined by the Scheme Adjudicator, the Scheme Company will deduct from that amount any amount owing by the Scheme Creditor to the Scheme Company, and pay the balance to the Scheme Creditor (in the unlikely event that there is a balance owing to the Scheme Company, the Scheme Creditor will have to pay that amount to the Scheme Company).Reversion to Run-Off  35 If the total amount of all claims exceeds a certain amount, the Scheme Company will have the option of terminating the Scheme and reverting to run-off.The amount is the amount for which provision for insurance liabilities has been made in the Scheme Company's accounts.For NRG London (Australian Branch), that amount is $7,032,000, and for NRG Victory, it is $11,788,000.36 The provision for reversion to run-off gives reassurance that the Scheme Companies will not be rendered insolvent as a result of an unexpectedly high value of Claims.37 The most significant potential detriment for a Scheme Creditor is the possibility that the value of a Scheme Creditor's claim will prove to be less than the amount of the indemnity to which the Scheme Creditor would have been entitled if run-off had continued.No doubt Scheme Creditors will take into account this disadvantage, and, on the other hand, the extent of the advantage to them of having money in hand, in determining whether to support the scheme.Identification and Notification of Potential Scheme Creditors  38 A review of the records of NRG London (Australian Branch) and NRG Victory has identified many potential Scheme Creditors.There remains, however, the possibility that some may not have been identified.It must be remembered that we are considering insurers that entered into contracts of reinsurance with a Scheme Company prior to 1991 in the case of NRG London (Australian Branch), and prior to 1993 in the case of NRG Victory.39 The records of NRG London (Australian Branch) identify only policyholders who have been in contact with NRG London (Australian Branch) since 1 July 1989, in connection, for example, with the payment or receipt of money, the provision of advice regarding premiums, or the notification of a claim.The records of NRG Victory disclose only the identity of all policyholders who have been in contact with it since 1 January 1994.40 Both Scheme Companies have, however, also made inquiries of managers or agents of various underwriting pools regarding the identity of any remaining claimants on the pools.41 In summary, all potential Scheme Creditors of both Scheme Companies have been identified except for any who have not had any contact with NRG London (Australian Branch) since 1 July 1989 or with NRG Victory since 1 January 1994.42 Most potential claimants on NRG London (Australian Branch) and on NRG Victory are Australian insurance companies.Other potential claimants are Australian entities that are not authorized insurers (such as government insurance offices and self-insurers), and some New Zealand, Papua New Guinean and Pacific Islands entities.43 In order to ensure that those possible further Scheme Creditors learn of the respective schemes, NRG London and NRG Victory will send copies of the Scheme Booklet to all authorised insurers in Australia, and to all brokers who have, to their knowledge, written business for NRG London (Australian Branch) or NRG Victory, as the case may be.44 NRG London and NRG Victory will also advertise the respective schemes in newspapers in Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.Those advertisements will provide contact details for potential Scheme Creditors to make inquiries and to obtain copies of the Scheme Booklet.45 There is a further category of policyholders who may be Scheme Creditors of NRG Victory.Between 1970 and 1974, NRG Victory accepted general insurance risks in South East Asia.It appears from the records of NRG Victory that this business was transferred to another company in 1974.It is not, however, possible to be certain that it was.46 No claims emanating from South East Asia have been made on NRG Victory, and no contact with NRG Victory has been made on behalf of any South East Asian policyholder since at least 1994.47 Given the apparent transfer of the South East Asian business to another company, and the lack of any known claims history, it is perhaps unnecessary that any steps be taken to notify potential South East Asian Scheme Creditors of NRG Victory, but in fact the NRG Victory scheme will be advertised in a newspaper in Asia.The Scheme Booklet  48 Because of the similarity between the two schemes, only one Scheme Booklet has been prepared for distribution to the Scheme Creditors under both schemes.This does not trouble me: the differences between the proposed schemes are so minor that a potential Scheme Creditor under one scheme will not be confused or misled by the presence in the Scheme Booklet of a discussion concerning the other scheme.49 The Scheme Booklet provides a comprehensive statement of:   (a) the way in which the schemes will operate; (b) the principal advantages and disadvantages of the schemes; (c) the financial circumstances of the Scheme Companies; (d) the steps required to be taken by potential Scheme Creditors in relation to the schemes, and the meetings at which the Schemes will be considered for approval; and (e) the absence of any interest on the part of the directors of the Scheme Companies that may be affected by the schemes.  50 The Scheme Booklet has been provided to APRA and ASIC.Certain parts of the Scheme Booklet constitute the Explanatory Statement for the schemes: see Corporations Act ss 411(1) , 412 (1).Estimation Methodology  51 The Estimation Methodology provides for a different approach to the valuation of claims, depending upon whether they are "property damage", "specific incident" or "latent injury" claims, and upon whether the claims are "known" or "incurred but not reported" ("IBNR").52 For property damage claims and specific incident claims that are known, the value will be the Scheme Creditor's estimate of the value of the particular claim, that is to say, the amount recorded by the Scheme Creditor as the expected settlement cost of the claim.53 For IBNR property damage claims and IBNR specific incident claims, no methodology has been prescribed.This is because it is considered unlikely that there will be any IBNR claims, and it will be incumbent upon a Scheme Creditor to prove that it has or may have such a claim, and how it should best be valued.54 For latent injury claims, the valuation methodology applicable to known and IBNR claims will be applied.That is because both types of latent injury claims share certain features which make their valuation a similar exercise.For example, even once the total damage suffered by an individual as a result of exposure to asbestos is known, there are likely to be questions of "sharing", both as between defendants and as between insurers.That is to say, because a person may have been exposed to asbestos from different sources and over a lengthy period of time, a Scheme Company may have an exposure only in respect of certain years or certain sources.As a result, liability for any one claim will usually be apportioned between different entities.The same considerations apply to IBNR asbestos claims.55 The approach adopted by the Estimation Methodology to the valuation of latent injury claims is to permit the Scheme Creditor a wide discretion as to the way in which it will substantiate its claim.The Estimation Methodology indicates that information should be supplied to establish such matters as the nature of the exposure, the number of policyholders likely to be affected, and the likely frequency of claims.The value of latent injury claims will be determined on the basis of the supporting information supplied by the Scheme Creditor.56 In all cases, there will be no discount applied to the value of a claim as a result of the proposed early payment, provided the claim is projected to settle within five years of the "Valuation Date" (30 June 2006).For claims that are projected to settle after 30 June 2011, the value of the claim will be discounted by 5.5% per annum, but only for the period from 30 June 2011 to the date of projected settlement.Classes of Creditors  57 Subsection 411(1) of the Corporations Act empowers the Court to order a meeting or meetings of creditors "or class of creditors" to be convened.There will be a separate meeting for each Scheme Company's Scheme Creditors (cf Re Safety Fix Pty Ltd [1962] VR 467 at 470), but it is not proposed to convene separate meetings for classes of Scheme Creditors of the one Scheme Company.58 Are there classes of Scheme Creditors for which separate meetings should be convened?59 If the answer to this question is yes, the proposed scheme to be considered at the class meetings would remain unchanged: there would be no change in the definition of the Scheme Creditors and there would not be a different scheme for each class.The scheme would be binding on either class only if agreed to by the necessary majority of the meeting of that class: see Corporations Act s 411(4).60 Unless the scheme were to be changed to stipulate that it could proceed as binding on only one class of Scheme Creditors, such as the IBNR Scheme Creditors (see below), the scheme would become binding only if agreed to by both classes at their separate meetings: in effect, each class would have a right of veto.This would be so, even if, for example, the total value of the claims of non-IBNR Scheme Creditors was quite small compared to the value of the total value of the claims of IBNR Scheme Creditors.(In passing, it should be noted that s 411(5) , which provides for an aggregation of the votes cast at separate meetings has no application: that subsection applies to multiple meetings of "creditors" or of the same "class of creditors, not to the separate meetings that necessarily arise from the existence of classes of creditors.) 61 Counsel for the Scheme Companies have fairly raised for the Court's consideration two possible bases for the ordering of separate meetings of classes of creditors: 2#8226; first, the distinction between IBNR and other Scheme Creditors; 2#8226; secondly, the distinction between Scheme Creditors that are, and those that are not, indebted to the Scheme Company, giving rise to a set off.62 I turn to the first possible basis of classification.Non-IBNR claims are to be valued at the settlement cost placed on them by the Scheme Creditor.Therefore, if the circumstances giving rise to the Scheme Company's reinsurance liability under a claim have occurred and been reported, the Scheme Creditor will receive the amount that it would have received in the ordinary course by way of indemnity.The Scheme Creditor will be in the same position as it would have been in if the Scheme Company had continued in run-off.IBNR Scheme Creditors, on the other hand, would be in a different position than that in which they would have been under a run-off, because their future (and contingent) claims will be valued and they will be paid out.As Lewison J observed in Re British Aviation Insurance Co Ltd [2005] EWHC 1621 (" BAIC ") (at [83]), "barring a miracle, the valuation will not be the same as the indemnity." 63 The significance of the notion of a "class" of creditors in the present context has been considered in several cases.In Sovereign Life Assurance Company v Dodd [1892] 2 QB 573 (" Sovereign Life "), Lord Esher MR said (at 579---580):  " The Act says that the persons to be summoned to the meeting (all of whom, be it said in passing, are creditors) are persons who can be divided into different classes --- classes which the Act of Parliament recognises, though it does not define them.This, therefore, must be done: they must be divided into different classes.What is the reason for such a course?It is because the creditors composing the different classes have different interests; and, therefore, if we find a different state of facts existing among different creditors which may differently affect their minds and their judgment, they must be divided into different classes." In the same case, Bowen LJ said (at 583) that a "class":  " must be confined to those persons whose rights are not so dissimilar as to make it impossible for them to consult together with a view to their common interest." 64 More recently, in Re Hills Motorway Ltd (2002) 43 ACSR 101 (" Hills Motorway "), Barrett J observed (at 104) that:  "The test is thus not one of identical treatment.It is one of community of interest.The court must ask itself whether the rights and entitlements of the different groups, viewed in the totality of the scheme's context, are so dissimilar as to make it impossible for them to consult together with a view to their common interest.The focus is not on the fact of differentiation but on its effects.The extent and nature of the differentiation must be measured in terms of the effect on the ability to consult together in a common interest or, in other words, the ability to come together in a single meeting and to debate the question of what is good or bad for the constituency as a whole and where the common good lies.Only if the differentiation destroys that ability --- the word used by Bowen LJ is 'impossible' --- does class distinction come to prevail."  See also Re HIH Casualty and General Insurance Ltd [2006] NSWSC 485 at [63] ff.65 In MMIA , Conti J referred (at [18], [19]) to "the class question" in the circumstances of a scheme generally similar to the present schemes.His Honour referred to Sovereign Life , Hills Motorway , and Re Hawk Insurance Co Ltd [2001] EWCA Civ 241 ; [2001] 2 BCLC 480 at 527, and, applying Bowen LJ's "impossibility of consulting together" test, held that a single meeting of all creditors was appropriate.66 In BAIC , Lewison J considered (at [83]) that on the facts of that case, policyholders with "known" or "accrued" claims constituted a separate class from policyholders with IBNR claims.His Lordship said (at [92]):  "In my judgment in the particular circumstances of a solvent scheme, where a solvent liquidation is not a realistic alternative, those with accrued claims and those with IBNR claims have interests which are sufficiently different as not to make it possible for them sensibly to consult together "in their common interest".In truth, they do not have a common interest at all." 67 The decision in BAIC has not, however, been treated as deciding that policyholders with accrued claims must always be treated as constituting a separate class from policyholders with IBNR claims.In Re NRG Victory Reinsurance Ltd [2006] EWHC 679 (' NRG Victory '), in which the circumstances were very similar to those of the present case, Lindsay J took the view that there was only one class of creditors.His Lordship said (at [17]):  "Whether separate classes for ['accrued' and IBNR claims] are truly necessary will depend on a long list of variables such that what is right for one company and one scheme will not necessarily be right for another.Where insurance companies are concerned, much will depend on matters such as the types of business which they covered and in what proportions between those classes of business; whether the business conducted was direct insurance or reinsurance and in what proportions; in what parts of the world, even, that their claimants are to be found; their solvency margins; how recently and when they stopped writing such new business as they used to write; the various times, class by class of business, at which they stopped; how long, accordingly, they have been in run-off and what has been their commutation experience." 68 Finally, in Re Sovereign Marine 2amp; General Insurance Co Ltd [2006] EWHC 1335 (" Sovereign Marine "), Warren J also emphasised that each case depends on its own facts (see, for instance, [114]), and ordered the convening of a single meeting of creditors to consider a "cut-off" scheme.69 BAIC is distinguishable on its facts.In particular, the creditors in that case were not, as they are here, all insurance companies.Indeed, "about 92 percent of its asbestos liabilities [were] owed to direct insureds": BAIC at [6].70 In the present case, the following features suggest the appropriateness of convening a meeting of only one class of creditors:  (a) The businesses in question are exclusively in the nature of reinsurance: the Scheme Creditors, all being insurers, can be expected to be commercially sophisticated and knowledgeable and to be able to assess where their best interests lie (in Sovereign Marine , Lindsay J regarded this consideration as a relevant distinction from the facts of BAIC ); (b) The whole of the reinsurance businesses (being in fact the whole businesses) of NRG London (Australian Branch) and NRG Victory will be subject to the schemes (as opposed to merely a part of those businesses being subject to the schemes); (c) The reinsurance businesses of the Scheme Companies have been in run-off for over twelve years (as opposed to a short period of run-off, with corresponding uncertainty about, or instability in, the portfolio's experience).(d) Both Scheme Companies have assets significantly in excess of their liabilities (so that all policyholders can be confident of receiving payment in full on their claims).(e) It is not expected that there will be many (or any) IBNR claims for property damage or specific incidents.It is expected that there will be IBNR claims for latent injuries, but in that case Mr. Collings has given evidence that the approach to determining both known and IBNR claims is similar.That is to say, in each case the approach is to determine the value of the claim in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles.(f) There is no suggestion that the value of any of the Scheme Companies' IBNR claims will be unable to be estimated.71 In my opinion, so far as the evidence reveals, it will be possible for Scheme Creditors of both IBNR and non-IBNR descriptions to consult together with a view to their common interest.It is not conclusive that the non-IBNR Scheme Creditors, or some of them, may be expected to think it immaterial to them whether the Scheme proceeds or not.72 For the above reasons, I do not think it appropriate to order separate meetings of IBNR and non-IBNR Scheme Creditors.73 It should be emphasised that if the meetings reveal a relevant problem, it will remain open to the Court not to approve the scheme.Indeed, although the observations made by Lewison J in BAIC related to the convening stage, in fact in that case the meeting of creditors had already been held and the question of the appropriateness of the single meeting as against class meetings was being dealt with at the approval hearing, at which some creditors appeared to oppose the granting of the approval.Indeed, in NRG Victory , Lindsay J observed (at [15]):   "... until the creditors have in fact had the opportunity of meeting and consulting together, it will be exceptionally difficult to be sure whether it will prove impossible or not for them to consult together with a view to their common interest.It is a somewhat broad test and there could well be cases where the creditors, given the chance to meet, prove more flexible, cohesive or mutually accommodating than their respective lawyers ahead of the event would have expected and that creditors, even lumped together, find no unfairness and more that is in common between them than might have been thought to be divisive." 74 As noted above, the other basis on which it might be suggested that meetings of classes of the Scheme Creditors are called for is that some Scheme Creditors will have a debt owing by them to the Scheme Companies set off against the value of their Claims.One (albeit unlikely) consequence of the application of a set-off is that the Scheme Creditor may be indebted to the Scheme Company.75 The fact of the existence of a set-off does not, however, change the fundamental nature of the compromise between the Scheme Company and the Scheme Creditors.In all cases, the issue to be decided by the Scheme Creditors is whether they wish to have their claims "accelerated" and valued now, or to call on their reinsurance indemnity in the ordinary course of run-off.It is by no means "impossible" for Scheme Creditors to discuss and consider that issue in circumstances where some of them will have countervailing amounts set off against their claims.76 For these reasons, I think that it is appropriate for only one meeting of the Scheme Creditors of each Scheme Company to be convened.Determination of Value for Voting at Meetings  77 The process by which the value of Scheme Creditors' claims will be determined for the purposes of voting at the scheme meetings is set out in the Scheme Booklet.Where a Scheme Company has sufficient information to make its own determination of the value of a Scheme Creditor's claim, it will pre-complete that Scheme Creditor's Claim Form, inserting an estimated value of the claim.The Scheme Creditor may accept that value, or it may reject it and specify a different value.78 The value of claims for voting purposes will be determined by the Chairperson of the meeting of Scheme Creditors.That decision will be based on:  (a) Information provided by the Scheme Creditor; (b) Information available to the Scheme Company from its records; and (c) Advice from the Scheme Actuary.79 The advice of the Scheme Actuary, who is the Scheme Companies' authorised actuary, Mr Collings, will ensure that the Chairperson will have available to him or her the advice of a suitably qualified and independent expert.That advice will be based upon the principles set out in the Estimation Methodology, referred to earlier.80 Finally, any remaining concern will, of course, be able to be raised by a Scheme Creditor at the confirmation hearing or, if it is applicable, pursuant to s 1321 of the Corporations Act .Compliance with the Corporations Act  81 The proposed schemes do not contravene the Corporations Act .In particular, the proposed Explanatory Statement complies with s 112(1).Disclosure to APRA and ASIC  82 Full details of the Schemes have been provided in a timely manner to both APRA and ASIC.In particular, the Scheme Booklet, incorporating the Explanatory Statement and the proposed schemes, has been provided to them.83 Both APRA and ASIC were notified of the date of the hearing, and indicated that they did not intend to appear to oppose the making of the orders sought.CONCLUSION  84 Orders as sought should be made.I certify that the preceding eighty-two (82) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lindgren.Associate:
