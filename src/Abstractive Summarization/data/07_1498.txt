 1 I gave reasons for judgment in these matters on 26 June 2007: see King v Northern Territory of Australia [2007] FCA 944.I ordered the parties to submit a draft determination and related orders within 6 weeks.Both the applicants and the Northern Territory submitted final draft determinations, with the Pastoral respondents primarily in agreement with the draft submitted by the Northern Territory.The final draft determinations left a number of issues to be resolved.The following indicates, in a summary way, how these issues should be resolved.The final determination is Annexure 1 to these reasons.Unless I indicate otherwise, the reference to a clause is to the clause in the final determination.References to "the reasons" are to the reasons given on 26 June 2007.2 First, there is an issue in relation to liberty to apply concerning structures (Order 5(c)).There is no evidence that structures were not constructed lawfully.Indeed, there is probably a legal presumption that they would have been constructed lawfully.The liberty to apply should be in the terms proposed by the Northern Territory.3 The second issue concerns the garbage reserve (clauses 11 and 12 of the applicants' draft determination and consequential references).I did not intend, by my reasons, to indicate that only certain native title rights and interests were extinguished.The examples given in those reasons were illustrative only.My conclusion is reflected in the terms proposed by the Northern Territory.4 It is not clear whether there is a residual issue about clause 8.At one point the applicants contended that the word "confer" should be included in that clause though the matter was not pursued in submissions.The inclusion of the word appears to me to be unnecessary and potentially misleading.The clause should be in the terms proposed by the Northern Territory.5 It is not clear whether there is a residual issue about clause 11(e).At one point the applicants appeared to suggest there should not be reference to lot 1 of the Township.There should be.The clause should be in the terms proposed by the Northern Territory.6 There is an issue at about how clause 12, the relationship clause, should be expressed.Clause 8 declares the native title rights and interests in exclusive areas.Clause 12, concerns the relationship between rights and interests in the non-exclusive areas and other rights and interests in those areas (being the other rights and interests identified in clause 11).The Northern Territory contends that clause 12 should make reference to clause 8 which concerns native title rights and interests in the exclusive areas.The applicants resist this.There is also an issue about whether the words "but did not extinguish" should be included in this clause.The Pastoralists oppose their inclusion but, if included, should be qualified by the words "except in accordance with law".7 As to this second issue, it is a new issue of potentially some significance which should have been raised during the hearing.No relevant concession was made by the applicants.I accept the submission of the applicants that the vast preponderance of determinations included the contentious formulation ("but did not extinguish") which appears also to be conformable with s 44H(c) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth).I am not persuaded it is clearly inappropriate for the words to be included nor am I persuaded that the qualification proposed by the Pastoralists is plainly necessary.Had the Pastoralists sought to agitate this issue at the hearing, it could have first been addressed by the parties and then in a reasoned judgment.Unless it is obvious that the qualification is necessary (and it is not obvious) or it is agreed, it should not be included as a part of the process of settling the form of the determination 8 As to the first issue (reference in clause 12 to clause 8), it is again a new issue of potentially some significance.The exclusive areas to which clause 8 relates are identified in schedule C, item 1(a) which are certain areas in the Town of Newcastle Waters.The interests in clause 11 include interests arising from the various pastoral leases, interests in relation to stock routes and miscellaneous interests including "the right of access by an employee, servant, agent or instrumentality of the Northern Territory or Commonwealth, or other statutory authority, as required in the performance of statutory duties" (clause 11(j)).As a matter of fact, it is highly probable, at the least, that many of these rights and interests (for example those of the pastoral leaseholders) would not and probably could not be exercised in relation to the exclusive areas (the areas in the Township identified in schedule C, item 1(a)).However the applicants accept that the rights identified in clause 11(j) can be exercised in the face of the native title rights and interests in the exclusive areas.It appears to me that this concession warrants the inclusion of a reference to clause 8 in clause 12 without determining whether it is necessary as a matter of law and notwithstanding, as just mentioned, most of the rights and interests identified in clause 11 probably have no legal or practical relevance to the exercise of the native title rights and interests in the exclusive areas.9 The remaining issues concern schedule D. There is an issue about the description of the lots in the Town of Newcastle Waters in that schedule.The Northern Territory proposes that the lots where native title rights and interests have been wholly extinguished simply be described by their lot numbers.The applicants suggests that in relation to certain lots the additional words "in respect of which there are being grants of freehold or leasehold estates" be added and, in relation to other lots, the words "in respect of which public works have been constructed or established".The applicants' suggestion appears to me to be unnecessary.Schedule D is simply a description of areas.They are sufficiently described by identifying the lots.My earlier reasons for judgment reveal why native title rights and interests have been wholly extinguished.10 Also in relation to schedule D, there is an issue about how the homestead and related buildings and structures should be described.The applicants propose "a homestead house, shed and buildings".The competing formulation is "the homestead complex".In view of the inclusion of the expression "any adjacent land", the formulation of the applicants is to be preferred.11 Again in relation to schedule D, there is an issue at about how the homestead and highway airstrips should be identified.For greater precision, it is appropriate to include the words "on NT portion 2093".12 Again in relation to schedule D, there is an issue at about whether reference should be made to "any constructed yard airstrips" and "any constructed roads".As discussed in my reasons for judgment, the evidence did not establish the existence of improvements of this type.It would potentially be misleading to refer them in schedule D and they should not be included.13 Again in relation to schedule D, it appears to be suggested that the expression "exclusive use of which is necessary" in item 4 is inapt.I dealt with this at [165] of the reasons.The applicants' formulation reflects those reasons and should be adopted.I certify that the preceding thirteen (13) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Moore.Associate:
