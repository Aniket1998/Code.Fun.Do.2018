 The desirability of ordering separate questions This case when viewed with 20/20 hindsight demonstrates the undesirability of ordering the determination of separate questions unless one can see a clear advantage for doing so, in the interests of justice.Separate questions will sometimes allow expense, that otherwise would be incurred in preparing extensive evidence on the quantification of damages, to be avoided.Sometimes the determination of a separate question will lead to a complete resolution of a matter.However, if the ordering of a separate question does not lead to such an outcome, the matter can often prove to be considerably more expensive and occupy much more court time than would otherwise be necessary.In Pascoe v Boensch [2008] FCAFC 147 ; (2008) 250 ALR 24 ('the separate question appeal') a Full Court said, at [10], in relation to this case:   'His Honour [Raphael FM] was satisfied that a finding on ... [the separate] question could lead to a complete termination of the proceeding or, at least, to a significant narrowing of the issues to be determined.Having heard the arguments on the appeal, we have reason to have a somewhat less sanguine view.'   The current application The applicant in this matter seeks leave to appeal from a judgment of Raphael FM of 13 August 2009 ( Pascoe v Boensch (No.9) [2009] FMCA 769) ('Pascoe v Boensch (No.9)') in which his Honour dealt with an application filed 9 April 2009 to amend the then existing Points of Claim, which had been filed on 25 August 2006, by replacing them with revised Amended Points of Claim proposed on 27 May 2009, and also with an application filed 1 September 2008 by the first respondent for summary dismissal of the applicant's Application filed 19 July 2006, in accordance with s 17A of the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 (Cth) ('the FMC Act') (the Federal Magistrates Court's equivalent of s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Federal Court Act').In relation to applications for leave to appeal, the power of this Court to allow amendments late in proceedings and the powers of the Court in relation to summary dismissal it is convenient to note the observations of the Full Court, comprising Spender, Graham and Gilmour JJ, in Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Limited [2009] FCAFC 117 ; (2009) 259 ALR 319 ('Kowalski').Important issues which arise in this case include: what is required by way of proof, in a summary dismissal application, to satisfy the court that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding or the relevant part thereof.was the application for leave to amend timely or not.The separate question In this case a separate question was formulated under Part 17 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 in relation to the validity of a declaration of trust by the first respondent to the present application, Mr Boensch, who was made bankrupt on 23 August 2005, which declared a trust over a property at 255 Victoria Road Rydalmere for the benefit of his children, Dominic and Stefanie.Raphael FM held that the declaration of trust was not a sham and that the trust had been duly constituted (see Pascoe v Boensch (No.3) [2007] FMCA 2038 ('Pascoe v Boensch (No.3)').This decision was upheld on appeal by a Full Court comprising Finn, Dowsett and Edmonds JJ in the separate question appeal on 18 August 2008.An application for special leave to appeal from the judgment of the Full Court was dismissed by the High Court on 12 March 2009.The preliminary question ordered on 6 September 2007 was expressed as follows:   'Does the Memorandum of Trust constitute a valid declaration of trust or otherwise create or recognize the creation of a valid interest in the property identified as the land and buildings at 255 Victoria Road Rydalmere?'   Raphael FM answered the preliminary question in the affirmative on 6 December 2007.The declaration of trust was in the following terms:   'This is a memorandum of trust created for the benefit of Boensch family with the most important purpose to provide secure means of support to the children of the marriage Dominic Boensch and Stefanie Boensch, after the divorce of their parents.    The trust property is the land and buildings at 255 Victoria Rd, Rydalmere, NSW.    Sabine Boensch will cause her share of ownership of that land to be transferred to Franz Boensch for him to hold the whole of land in trust as described above.    In due course Franz Boensch will arrange with a solicitor or accountant to prepare a detailed trust document, professionally drafted to give best protection to the children and to ensure favourable tax treatment of income earned by the trust.
